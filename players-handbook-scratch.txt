Races
=====

Humans
------

Humans are the dominant race in the centrals cities and in the nation at large, despite the 
generally high levels of diversity in the country. Humans tend to hold the majority of positions of
influence both in the economic and political spheres.

Dwarves
-------

Because of the rich underground resources in the country, Dwarves are frequently drawn here. Many
Dwarves work in mines in the outlying areas of the nation, but many certain do find their way to
the central cities.
Dwarves most often find Crent to their liking, as the ever-open markets and vendors offer a great
opportunity to sell their wares and find rare materials. Some Dwarves with an eye for government
or leadership settle in Regunt and take a post at the head of a guild or legal office. Dwarves 
rarely tend to have the patience for as wild a city as Oblectant.

Elves
-----

Elves do come to the central cities in some numbers, but are rarely found elsewhere the nation.
Drawn by the wealth of craftsmanship and artistic talent, Elves come to display their own prowess
and compare their works to other master artisans. Because of this, most Elves make their home in
a de-facto Elven district in Crent, where they can live in a manner closer to home while still 
reaping the advantages of the city. Elves almost never bother with the political and mercantile
business that takes place in Regunt, but sometimes are drawn to the lively music and performances
in Oblectant.

Gnomes
------

The constant festivites and general excitement of Oblectant are perfectly suited to the typical
Gnome's mentality. There they delight in taking part in or simply watching performances. While some
rise to great heights in official groups, most Gnomes find great pleasure in being street performers
or vendors. Gnomes with an eye for business or a craving for the excitement of mercantile 
enterprises will sometimes venture into Crent to try their luck there.
Regunt is far to boring and rigid for the majority of Gnomes and they are rarely seen
there.

Halflings
---------

The hubbub and excitement of the central cities are perfectly suited to a Halfling's demeanor, and
they can be found in great numbers in any of the cities. Artisans, shopkeepers, performers, and
even occasionally politicians, a Halfling's upbeat and amiable attitude is a formidable asset.

Half-Elves
----------

Half-elves face no discrimination for the mixed origin in any of the central cities, where diversity
is welcome and omnipresent. Because of this welcoming environment, Half-Elves have flourished in
the region and many travel from distant lands to come here. Here, their mixed origin plays to their
advantage, and they are well suited to any role in the cities. However, many heed the call of their
Elven side and find themselves as either artisans in Crent or performers in Oblectant.

Half-Orcs
---------

Although diversity is welcomed in the central cities, brutishness and crass are not. Although not
hated or feared by any means, most Half-Orcs simply do not fit into the lifestyle of these cities,
and so choose instead to live in the outlying towns and villages of the nation. Those who do choose
to live the cities tend to make their living as bodyguards for wealthy politicians or merchants, or
as a part of the police force.

=== The Government of {nation_name}

Outwardly, the government of glossterm::[{nation_name}] is 
composed of three parts: a Senate, an Emperor and glossterm::[{HoRs}]. 
Every four years, citizens elect glossterm::[{HoRs}] to speak for their regions' 
interests in government affairs. While they lack individual power, as a 
collective the glossterm::[{HoRs}] possess great strength, and most take immense 
pride in their role. They elect the Emperor from their ranks and may even vote 
to forcibly remove Senators from office for life. Consequently, even the most 
powerful officials respect glossterm::[{HoRs}] as the voice of the people.

The current Emperor, person::[{emperor}], was elected five years ago. Thus far, 
his term has been mostly uneventful. person::[{emperor},'Emperor {l}'] has not 
needed to wield his power to veto any major proposals, resolve clutch ties in 
the Senate, or directly command the glossterm::[{police}]. Popular opinion is 
that he will choose to hold a twenty year term like most of his predecessors, 
though no law requires him to do so.

While the Emperor and glossterm::[{HoRs}] are elected officials, each of the 
nation's eminent temples are granted a number of Senate seats corresponding to 
their influence. Senators, once inaugurated, occupy their positions for life, 
unless deposed by the glossterm::[{HoRs}]. Because Senators wield mighty power 
such as ratification of laws and calling for immediate re-election of the 
Emperor, the temples deliberate carefully when selecting leaders to become 
Senators. As a result, most Senators are level-headed and keenly aware that they 
must walk the line between the interests of their temples, the people, and the 
nation at large.

.Who's in the Senate?
*********************
A temple receives a number of Senate positions corresponding with its influence 
in the nation, be it influence through size of congregation, wealth, or other 
means. Currently, the temple of Abadar is allocated eight senate seats. Shelyn 
holds three, and Sarenrae and Cayden Cailean each hold two. Pharasma, Iomedae, 
and Erastil are all represented, but each holds only one seat.
*********************

In practice, of course, the government is much more than just the sum of its 
leadership.  Of the various government agencies and divisions, the largest and 
most publicly visible are the glossterm::[{police}], the 
glossterm::[{customs_dept}], and the glossterm::[{public_works}].  The 
glossterm::[{police}] is charged with maintaining peace and safety throughout 
the nation, and is the closest thing glossterm::[{nation_name}] has to a 
military force. The current head of police, person::[{police_head}], continues 
to uphold the organization's excellent reputation.  Although he may claim that 
they are chronicly understaffed and underfunded, glossterm::[{nation_name}] is 
an incredibly safe country.  The glossterm::[{customs_dept}] levying taxes on 
exported goods, and also control and maintain the glossterm::[{portals}, magical 
gates] that lead to glossterm::[{nation_name}]. The glossterm::[{public_works}] 
builds and maintains infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and waterways. It 
also settles disputes over public lands, most frequently regarding the ancient 
relics scattered about the country.

    <para>
      Due to the high economic and entertainment specialties of <glossterm baseform="&nation_name;">&nation_name;</glossterm>, it draws craftsman
      and tourists from all over the world. Unless described otherwise, you can assume that almost
      any race can be represented as either a craftsman or a tourist.
    </para>
    <para>
      Futhermore, the nation of <glossterm baseform="&cliffs_nation;">&cliffs_nation;</glossterm> has no discrimination against any race so long as 
      they can carry their weight in war. <glossterm baseform="&cliffs_nation_person;">&cliffs_nation_person;</glossterm> bodyguards, hunters, policemen, and 
      members of any other profession that involves martial prowess can easily find employment in 
      <glossterm baseform="&nation_name;">&nation_name;</glossterm> regardless of their racial background.

      <title>Humans</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Humans are the dominant race in the central cities and in the nation at large, despite the 
      generally high levels of diversity in the country. Humans native to <glossterm baseform="&nation_name;">&nation_name;</glossterm>
      are represented in all professions, and tend to hold the majority of influential positions 
      both in the economic and political spheres. They can be found in every major city and in the
      outlying areas of the country.
    </para> 
    <para>
      Humans hailing from other parts of the continent tend to come to <glossterm baseform="&nation_name;">&nation_name;</glossterm> for
      more specialized reasons. Farmers, clerics on pilgrimage, and visiting aristocrats from 
      <glossterm baseform="&meadows_nation;">&meadows_nation;</glossterm> are all common sights. The goat-riding <glossterm baseform="&mountainmen;">&mountainmen;</glossterm> 
      from the peaks of <glossterm baseform="&mountains_nation;">&mountains_nation;</glossterm>
      are more rare, but sometimes come down to the valley for supplies or when they are seeking
      lesser or perhaps even greater solitude than they found among their people in the mountains.
      The exotic <glossterm baseform="&firepeople;">&firepeople;</glossterm> from neighboring <glossterm baseform="&desert_kingdom;">&desert_kingdom;</glossterm> are often employed as guides and 
      laborers, although some have left their homes to make a living as performers in <glossterm baseform="&arts_city;">&arts_city;</glossterm>.
      Humans from <glossterm baseform="&forest_nation;">&forest_nation;</glossterm> are significantly more rare, but occasionally a prodigy from the 
      mage's academy or a wayward druid will make an appearance.

      <title>Dwarves</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Because of the rich underground resources in the country, dwarves are frequently drawn here.
      Most dwarves hail from the mountains in <glossterm baseform="&mountains_nation;">&mountains_nation;</glossterm> to live with their bretheren in the 
      large network of dwarven homes that have been built under the earth. Although most dwarves
      will be living in the outlying areas of the nation, many certainly do find their way to
      the central cities. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Most dwarves will find <glossterm baseform="&market_city;">&market_city;</glossterm> to their liking, as the ever-open markets and vendors 
      offer a great opportunity to sell their wares and find rare materials. Some dwarves with an 
      eye for government or leadership settle in <glossterm baseform="&law_city;">&law_city;</glossterm> and take a post in a guild 
      or legal office. Dwarves in the legal realm tend to put their strong racial loyalties to use
      defending the interests of other dwarves, and as such many find their way into positions as 
      District Representatives. Dwarves rarely tend to have the patience for as wild a city as
      <glossterm baseform="&arts_city;">&arts_city;</glossterm>.

      <title>Elves</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Elves do come to the central cities in some numbers, but are rarely found elsewhere the nation.
      Drawn by the wealth of craftsmanship and artistic talent, elves come to display their own prowess
      and compare their works to other master artisans'. Because of this, most elves make their home in
      a de-facto elven district in <glossterm baseform="&market_city;">&market_city;</glossterm>, where they can live in a manner closer to home while still 
      reaping the advantages of the city. Elves almost never bother with the political and mercantile
      business that takes place in <glossterm baseform="&law_city;">&law_city;</glossterm>, but sometimes are drawn to the lively music and performances
      in <glossterm baseform="&arts_city;">&arts_city;</glossterm>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Most of the elves living in <glossterm baseform="&nation_name;">&nation_name;</glossterm> hail from from <glossterm baseform="&forest_nation;">&forest_nation;</glossterm>, and those that are 
      not craftsmen are most often artists or performers, members of the mage's academy, druids, 
      rangers, or clerics of Shelyn.

    <para>
      The constant festivites and general excitement of <glossterm baseform="&arts_city;">&arts_city;</glossterm> are perfectly suited to the typical
      gnome's demeanor. There they delight in taking part in or simply watching performances. While some
      rise to great heights in official groups, most gnomes find great pleasure in being street performers
      or vendors. Gnomes with an eye for business or a craving for the excitement of mercantile 
      enterprises will sometimes venture into <glossterm baseform="&market_city;">&market_city;</glossterm> to try their luck there.
      <glossterm baseform="&law_city;">&law_city;</glossterm> is far too boring and rigid for the majority of Gnomes, and they are rarely seen
      there.

      <title>Halflings</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Halflings dovetail with ease into the hubbub and excitement of the central cities, and
      they can be found in great numbers all over the country. 
      Artisans, shopkeepers, performers, and even occasionally politicians, a <glossterm baseform="&nation_person;">&nation_person;</glossterm> 
      halfling's upbeat and amiable attitude is a formidable asset.
    </para>
    <para>
      Halflings coming from <glossterm baseform="&meadows_nation;">&meadows_nation;</glossterm> are often members of the merchant class, seeking 
      potential business partners. The rural, hill-giant loving halflings from <glossterm baseform="&mountains_nation;">&mountains_nation;</glossterm>
      are more likely to become farmers in the outskirts of the nation.

      <title>Half-Elves</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Half-elves face no discrimination for their mixed origin in any of the central cities, where diversity
      is welcome and omnipresent. Because of this welcoming environment, half-elves have flourished in
      the region and many travel from distant lands to come here. They are the second most populous
      race in <glossterm baseform="&nation_name;">&nation_name;</glossterm>. Here, their mixed origin plays to their
      advantage, and they are well suited to any role. However, many heed the call of their
      elven side and find themselves as either artisans in <glossterm baseform="&market_city;">&market_city;</glossterm> or performers in <glossterm baseform="&arts_city;">&arts_city;</glossterm>.
    </para>

      <title>Half-Orcs</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Although diversity is welcomed in the central cities, brutishness and crassness are not. Although not
      hated or feared by any means, most half-orcs simply do not fit into the lifestyle of these cities,
      and so choose instead to live in the outlying towns and villages of the nation. Those who do choose
      to live the cities tend to make their living as bodyguards for wealthy politicians or merchants, or
      as a part of the police force.

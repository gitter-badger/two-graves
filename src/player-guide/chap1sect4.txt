=== The Government of {nation_name}

Outwardly, the government of glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}] is 
composed of three parts: a Senate, an Emperor and glossterm::[{HoRs}, {HoRs}]. 
Every four years, citizens elect glossterm::[{HoRs}] to represent their 
districts' interests in governmental affairs. While they lack individual power, 
as a collective they command great strength, and most take great pride in their 
role. glossterm::[{HoRs}] elect the Emperor from their ranks and may even vote 
to forcibly remove Senators from office for life. Consequently, even the most 
powerful officials respect glossterm::[{HoRs}] as the will of the people.

The current Emperor, person::[{emperor}], was elected five years ago. In what 
has been a mostly uneventful term so far, he has not needed to wield his power 
to veto any major laws, resolve clutch ties in the Senate, or directly command 
the glossterm::[{police}]. Popular opinion is that he will choose to hold a 
twenty year term like most of his predecessors, though no law requires him to do 
so.

The Senate comprises eighteen leaders chosen from and by the nation's eminent
temples, with each temple holding a number of positions corresponding to their
influence.  Senators are solely responsible for ratifying laws, and they also
have the power to call for an immediate re-election of the Emperor.

.Who's in the Senate?
*********************
Currently, the temple of Abadar is allocated eight senate seats. Shelyn holds
three, and Sarenrae and Cayden Cailean each hold two. Pharasma, Iomedae, and
Erastil are all represented, but each holds only one seat.
*********************

In practice, of course, the government is much more than just the sum of its
leadership.  Of the various agencies and divisions that constitute the
government, the largest and most publicly visible are the glossterm::[{police},
{police}], the glossterm::[{customs_dept}, {customs_dept}], and the
glossterm::[{public_works}, {public_works}].  The glossterm::[{police},
{police}] is charged with maintaining peace and safety throughout the nation,
and is the closest thing glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}] has to a
military force.  The current head of police, person::[{police_head}], continues
to uphold the organization's excellent reputation.  Although he may claim that
they are chronicly understaffed and underfunded, glossterm::[{nation_name},
{nation_name}] is an incredibly safe country.  The glossterm::[{customs_dept},
{customs_dept}] controls and maintains the magical gates that lead to
glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}], and are also responsible for levying
taxes on exported goods.  The glossterm::[{public_works}, {public_works}] builds
and maintains infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and waterways, and also
settles disputes over public lands, most frequently regarding the ancient relics
scattered about the country.

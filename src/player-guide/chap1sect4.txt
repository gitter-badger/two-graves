=== Religion in {nation_name}

Although the nation is not aligned with any one deity, 
glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}'s] roots in the 
glossterm::[{crusade_org}]' <<player-guide.nat_history,religious crusade>> are 
still apparent to this day. The country's most influential temples direct its 
future from the Senate, while the glossterm::[{crusade_org}] work tirelessly 
around the world to spread the gospel of civilization's crowning achievements.

The temple of Abadar has maintained major power in the nation, and from the 
gilded halls of <<player-guide.abadar_temple>> in 
<<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>> it oversees much of the nation's financial 
and legal well-being.  Shelyn and Cayden Cailean both have large followings in 
<<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>>. Their temples, 
<<player-guide.shelyn_temple>> and <<player-guide.cc_temple>>, draw tourists and 
worshippers from far and wide with the promise of first rate entertainment and
culture.

.Mystery of the Shrines
***********************
Scattered around the landscape of glossterm::[{nation_name}] are mysterious 
shrines. The shrines wield various potent magics, from healing, to increased 
strength and speed, to the ability to breath underwater for a time. Although the 
purpose and origin of these shrines is contested fact, access to them is highly 
valued, and many groups vie for stewardship of these relics.
***********************

Iomedae's temple is the <<player-guide.police_hq>> in 
<<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>>, and much of the glossterm::[{police}] are 
devotees. Sarenrae, Pharasma, and Erastil enjoy large popular support from all 
around the nation for their public services and good works, but they do not 
maintain large shrines or temples in any one location.  Many other faiths have 
worshippers in glossterm::[{nation_name}], and although they do not hold 
prominent political power, Desna, Gozreh, Calistria, and Irori all have 
noteworthy followings around the country.

=== The Central Cities

The Central Cities are the largest urban centers in glossterm::[{nation_name}]. 
They represent the peak of culture and progress in the nation, and each of them 
has developed their own unique customs and specialties over time.

.Common Government Resources
****************************
You can expect most government agencies that deal with infrastructure will have 
representation in all large settlements, although they may not be specifically 
called out in these sections. This includes, but is not limited to, divisions 
such as the glossterm::[{police}], glossterm::[{public_works}], and other 
servants of the common good.
****************************

[[player-guide.arts_city]]
==== {arts_city}, City of Arts

Brimming with life and activity, the city of 
<<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>> is the veritable pulse of 
glossterm::[{nation_name}]. Artists and entertainers from all walks of life 
flock to join in <<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}'s>> city's cultural 
melting pot and experience the wealth the city has to offer. Anywhere is a 
stage, and revelry spills out into the streets, infusing the city with a 
constant state of festivity. Each day could bring new celebrations replete with 
performances and displays unlike any seen before it. As a result, 
<<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>> is a hot spot for tourists from around 
the world, and their presence ensures that there is plenty of gold to keep the 
entertainers at their antics.

Officials long gave up on imposing bureaucracy upon the citizens, and now simply 
seek to ensure that the city runs smoothly from one performance to the next. The 
last vestige of control the government maintains over the celebrations is the 
glossterm::[{festival_agency}], which stages city-wide festivals, schedules 
access to large venues such as <<player-guide.stadium>>, and provides publicity 
for ambitious performers. The glossterm::[{police}] patrols the streets, keeping 
the city safe for residents and tourists alike, but their presence is 
understated and does not impinge on the <<player-guide.arts_city, 
{arts_city}'s>> carefree atmosphere. Petty crime is uncommon, and offenders are 
swiftly swept to the nearest police station or courthouse for judgment.

Despite the apparent laissez-faire attitude of the government, 
<<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>> is extremely well-maintained. Buildings 
of sturdy wood and cut stone stand strong against the neverending flow of 
residents, and paved streets make for easy transport around the city. Lights 
both magical and mundane line the streets and buildings, vying for the attention 
of passersby. Even with messy tourists who care not for the city's cleanliness, 
strong sewers and <<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}'s >> famed trash removal 
kobolds sweep away the filth and leave the city ready for the festivities to 
continue.

===== Places of Interest

[[player-guide.amphitheater,{amphitheater}]]{amphitheater}::
  Rows of enormous amethyst crystals jutting from the entrance give
  <<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}'s>> premier amphitheater it's
  name. Although its appearance and sublime acoustics would suggest a man-made
  structure, {amphitheater} is actually a naturally occurring geode
  phenomenon. Performing even once in the {amphitheater} is the goal of many
  artists, and competition is fierce. The revered glossterm::[{auditioners},
  {auditioners}] are the final elite arbiters of who will be graced by the
  stage.

[[player-guide.shelyn_temple,{shelyn_temple}]]{shelyn_temple}::
  Vivid botanical gardens and serene marble galleries compose the nation's
  premier temple of Shelyn. The temple is built on the edge of the city and
  situated near the <<player-guide.amphitheater>> so that the clergy may more
  easily tend to the amphitheater. Compared to the intensity of the city,
  {shelyn_temple} is truly a sanctuary for those who wish to reflect upon the
  spiritual impact of the arts.


[[player-guide.arts_college,{arts_college}]]{arts_college}::
  {arts_college} is one of the world's most prestigious schools for the fine
  arts, and a central location for both prospective students and tourists
  alike. Although its intimidating spires, sharply slanted rooftops, and aged
  stone walls cast an imposing shadow, they belie the energy within. Its campus
  buzzes jovially at all hours of the day as some of the greatest creative
  geniuses from around the globe hone their skills.

[[player-guide.stadium,{stadium}]]{stadium}::
  Named for the carpet of small purple flowers that blooms in the 
  spring, the {stadium} is an expansive, open-air park and a prime
  location for many public events. Complete with several small 
  venues for performances as well as a large stadium, the 
  {stadium} boasts ample space and seating for tourists and citizens
  alike. Whether it be music, sports, or festivals, an event in the
  {stadium} is sure to be lively and draw a large crowd.

{bridge}::
  Spanning the glossterm::[{arts_city_river}, {arts_city_river} River] and
  joining the east and west of <<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>> together,
  the {bridge} is more than just an important piece of infrastructure.  Many
  bits of <<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>> culture have incoporated the
  {bridge}, from tossing flowers into the river below for good luck to being a
  hotspot for watching fireworks.  More practically, it's also a natural
  chokepoint for traffic through the city and its wide stone path is filled with
  street performers, each trying to take advantage of their captive audiences.

[[player-guide.cc_temple,{cc_temple}]]{cc_temple}::
  A large stone carving of a frothing mug adorns the facade of
  <<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}'s>> favorite temple to the god of
  drinking and merriment. This multi-story wood and stone building radiates a
  warmth and festivity that can be felt from blocks away. The temple hosts a
  stage and doubles as both a comedy house and theater for celebrations of
  bravey, and its walls reverberate with laughter and cheers. To the confusion
  of tourists and the amusement of locals, the interior of the temple is themed
  as a bank.

{arts_city_tourist_district}::
  Surrounding <<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}'s>> central plazas, this
  bustling district is a hotspot for tourism and revelry. Although most come to
  the district to be at the center of the city's constant festivals, the
  competition between enterprises to garner attention has changed the district
  into a spectacle in its own right. Themed businesses, wild street performers,
  and garish decorations all lend a hand in creating the district's unique
  atmosphere.

{arts_city_college_district}::
  Fed by the youthful, creative energies of the <<player-guide.arts_college>>,
  the {arts_city_college_district} is the premiere place to scout rising talent
  and share ideas in the city. Although not as upscale as some parts of
  <<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>>, the inhabitants of the district are
  jovial and create a welcoming atmosphere. Collaboration and competition go
  hand-in-hand here, and it's very likely to see spontaneous performances erupt
  in the persuit of great art.

{arts_city_rich_district}::
  Mostly separated from the hustle and bustle of the city, the
  {arts_city_rich_district} provides a serene place for those who can afford
  it. Residents and visitors enjoy beautiful courtyards, spotless streets, and
  exclusively close access to iconic locations such as
  <<player-guide.amphitheater>> and <<player-guide.shelyn_temple>>.

{arts_city_poor_district}::
  To call {arts_city_poor_district} a slum would be disingenuous, but compared
  to the rest of <<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>> this district falls
  behind in upkeep and cleanliness.  Tenement housing is plentiful, and in lieu
  of access to more fanciful pursuits, the residents of
  {arts_city_poor_district} excel in vice entertainment.  Seedy bars and
  brothels adorn the streets, and the venues host bawdy and burlesque
  performances too vulgar for popular taste.

{arts_city_govt_district}::
  Tucked away in a less-noticeable portion of the city,
  {arts_city_govt_district} houses offices and storage for government agencies
  such as the glossterm::[{police}, {police}] and glossterm::[{festival_agency},
  {festival_agency}].

{arts_city_quality_district}::
  Many master craftsmen who outfit <<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>> with
  superior quality instruments and supplies base their workshops in
  {arts_city_quality_district}. These great makers demand a particular
  environment for their work, and the district has molded to reflect their
  tastes. Simple, refined architecture and narrow cobbled streets give the
  district a historic atmosphere, and even the wildest of locals calm themselves
  out of respect when in the area.

[[player-guide.market_city]]
==== {market_city}, City of Markets

The sound of roaring forges and workshops blends with the clink of coins in the 
vibrant market city of <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>>. Known for its 
unparalleled selection of masterwork and exotic goods, 
<<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>> is a haven for craftsmen.  The best 
of the best travel here to study with other masters from all around. The result 
is a crucible of rivalries and collaborations which drive the innovations of 
these ambitious creators ever forward. This work and success have brought 
incredible reknown to both <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>> and the 
nation as a whole, and wealth naturally flows to the city in the form of 
hardened merchants and more casual buyers.

The siren call of riches and skill brings along with it much more strict 
government oversight. Left to their own devices, foreign merchants would surely 
bleed the country dry. In response, agencies such as the 
glossterm::[{customs_dept}] and the glossterm::[{labor_dept}] keep close watch 
on the conditions of the city. Given the amount of coin that flows through the 
streets, the glossterm::[{police}] are omnipresent in 
<<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>>, ensuring that the city retains its 
name as a safe and reputable haven for trade.

[role="half-image"]

The master craftsmen themselves are no pushovers either. Crafting guilds are 
strictly forbidden both in a legal sense and a communal one. Here, each 
individual crafter vies for the reputation of her own name. Consequently, mutual 
respect{mdash}even among the most obvious of rivals{mdash}is paramount and 
palpable in the transactions that take place here.

To feed the high demand of buyers, <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>> 
has built itself up around a system of attractive and efficient roads and 
neighborhoods. No space is wasted in thoroughfares large or small, as every bit 
of available wall space is transformed into a storefront or workshop. Sturdy 
stone buildings resist wear from unending shoppers, but also from nature's 
harshness and the occasional workshop fire. Goods transit smoothly through the 
city's wide, paved streets{mdash}their navigation made easy by numerous road 
markers. At night, hanging iron lamps illuminate the city's famous twenty-four 
hour markets.

===== Places of Interest

[[player-guide.grand_bazaar,{grand_bazaar}]]{grand_bazaar}::
  Thousands of shoppers browse the rows of tents that fill this enormous
  open-air market. As one of <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}'s>>
  internationally iconic features, the {grand_bazaar} is home to all sorts of
  novelties and unique items. Although locally regarded as more for show than
  function, it is not unheard of to find true treasures nestled in the wares
  here.
  
{market_house}::
  Dozens of imposing wooden boards line the walls of this large forum, each
  filled with statistics and predictions for various market goods. Harried
  merchant apprentices hustle along the walls with tablets and chalk in an
  unending effort to keep the boards up to date.  Meanwhile, cold-faced
  merchants and crafters eye the ever changing boards like vipers ready to
  strike.
  
[[player-guide.elven_enclave,{elven_enclave}]]{elven_enclave}::
  {elven_enclave} is glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}'s] largest single
  home of elves. Here they have fostered a small forest grove and made their
  homes in its trunks and boughs. Elves, Half-Elves, and fey races are openly
  welcomed, but most others find themselves loosely tolerated as permanent
  residents.
  
{dwarven_enclave}::
  Not to be outdone by the forest of <<player-guide.elven_enclave>> or the cut
  stone of <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>> itself, the Dwarves
  constructed a miniature mountainscape out of boulders from the nation's
  mines. Now complete with carved homes and bold designs, {dwarven_enclave} is a
  colony in its own right. Although legally no citizen may be forbidden
  residence here, most non-Dwarves find the stony, cramped interior unwelcoming.
  
[[player-guide.market_city_harbor,{market_city_harbor}]]{market_city_harbor}::
  Cargo boats fill the numerous docks of this large harbor on the
  glossterm::[{valley_lake}, {valley_lake}]. Much of
  <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}'s>> imports and exports pass through
  this harbor, and deckhands work feverishly to keep the flow of goods moving.
  
{arts_city_river} River Customs::
  Owned by the glossterm::[{customs_dept}, {customs_dept}], this customs house 
  sits on an island in the glossterm::[{arts_city_river}, {arts_city_river} 
  River] just before it passes through the city. Ships queue up to have their 
  cargo inspected and their paperwork approved by the grim-faced and serious 
  officials who work here.
  
[[player-guide.market_city_rich_district,{market_city_rich_district}]]{market_city_rich_district}::
  Perched atop the highest hill of <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}'s>>
  lakeshore, {market_city_rich_district} houses the wealthiest citizens and
  dignitaries of the city.  A stunning lakeside vista complements the opulent
  estates here, and the city's most reputable envoys traverse the boulevards on
  business for their employers.
  
[[player-guide.market_city_shopping_district,{market_city_shopping_district}]]{market_city_shopping_district}::
  The {market_city_shopping_district} is home to the majority of
  <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}'s>> storefronts and markets, and is
  the city's largest and most famous district. From small one-man storefronts to
  the <<player-guide.grand_bazaar>> itself, the {market_city_shopping_district}
  encompasses trade of all sizes and types.
  
{market_city_workshop_district}::
  Strategically located between the <<player-guide.market_city_harbor>> and the
  storefronts of <<player-guide.market_city_shopping_district>>, the
  {market_city_workshop_district} provides for makers who require larger, more
  complex facilities. The sounds of creation clamour forth from the district's
  workshops and forges as each crafter develops his next masterpiece.
  
{market_city_residential_district}::
  {market_city_residential_district} provides accommodation for those residents
  who do not live in their stores or workshops, and those visitors who choose
  not to pay the premiums of inns in the
  <<player-guide.market_city_shopping_district>>.  Although they are not the
  gilded estates of <<player-guide.market_city_rich_district>>, the homes and
  buildings in this district are by no means in shambles. Even the simplest
  housing in <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>> reflects the city's
  wealth and high standards of living.
  
{market_city_govt_district}::
  Home to the offices of information brokers, merchant guild members, and
  government officials, the {market_city_govt_district} hosts the unseen web of
  data and law that keeps the city running. Through word of mouth and fleet
  couriers, information and orders rush from this district to recipients within
  and beyond <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}'s>> borders.

[[player-guide.law_city]]
==== {law_city}, City of Laws

At the heart of glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}] is the nation's crown 
jewel: the capital city of <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>>. Towering, 
gleaming buildings of marble and polished stone strike a grand vista for those 
who first lay eyes upon the city. Orderly grids of streets and avenues bustle 
with activity, each individual doing his part to propel the nation towards 
progress. At night, although the streets quiet to dim illumination by heavy iron 
lamps, the work of the city does not cease. Buildings big and small come to life 
as interior lights shine through their windows, offering tantalizing hints at 
the ongoings within.

From first sight to last, <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>> whisks away
newcomers and locals alike into an embrace of structure and control that seems
almost caring. The city runs like clockwork, with each inhabitant and agency
fulfilling a purpose in a timely and efficient manner. From the lowliest
courier to the highest seats of government, every citizen of
<<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>> is devoted fully to their cause. To do
otherwise would be to invite certain scorn and disdain from one's peers.

Just as each citizen is devoted to their tasks, so is the city itself devoted to
the law. Law is born and dies in <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>>. Every
agency houses its highest offices here in this locus of government power. Yet
despite the proximity of government control, the city does not quake under the
tyranny of authoritarianism. That the government serves its people is a well
respected fact, and it is commonly understood that
<<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>> only functions at the willing compliance of
its citizens.

===== Places of Interest

[[player-guide.law_city_capitol,{law_city_capitol}]]{law_city_capitol}::
  A quartet of obelisks surround this domed building which towers above the
  inner city. With architectural adornments and intricacies that border on
  ostentatiousness, the seat of glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}'s]
  governmental power serves as a constant reminder of the nation's political and
  economic mastery. Here the Senate holds council with the Emperor, and the
  majority of government agencies also keep their headquarters within.
  
{main_portal}::
  A gilded quarter-sphere in the north of the city contains the divine
  masterpiece through which travel using the glossterm::[{portals}, {portals}]
  is made possible. Heavily staffed by the glossterm::[{police}, {police}] and
  the glossterm::[{customs_dept}, {customs_dept}], hundreds of travelers are
  processed daily here.  The quarter-sphere opens to a dazzling view of the
  <<player-guide.law_city_capitol>>, imposing the nation's crown jewel as the
  first and last thing journeyers see during their time in
  glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}].
  
[[player-guide.abadar_temple,{abadar_temple}]]{abadar_temple}::
  Originally the capitol building during the nation's infancy, Abadar's temple
  has since returned to its primary function.  Although it may not have the same
  prestige it once did, the temple has certainly not degraded in splendor. From
  within the church's golden halls the clergy works tirelessly to bring the
  vision of their forebears, the glossterm::[{crusade_org}, {crusade_org}], to
  life.
  
[[player-guide.merchant_guild_hq,{merchant_guild_hq}]]{merchant_guild_hq}::
  Just to the north of the docks and warehouses on the
  glossterm::[{valley_lake}, {valley_lake}] are a series of large but
  utilitarian guildhalls. Collected within are offices of the various merchant
  guilds that do business in glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}]. Although
  the guilds would almost certainly prefer to be headquartered in
  <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>>, the law requires that they be
  located here in <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>>. The cunning merchants
  have made the best of their situation, though, taking every opportunity to
  endlessly lobby in the interest of their guilds.
  
[[player-guide.law_uni,{law_uni}]]{law_uni}::
  In the west of the city is the {law_uni}.  It is the incubator of
  <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}'s>> commercial and political genius and
  also the prime entry point to the upper echelons of glossterm::[{nation_name},
  {nation_name}'s] political economy. It is neigh unheard of that prominent
  figures do not have some tie to the university.  As a result, its student body
  does not just comprise promising, untested politicians and merchants, but also
  veterans and experts from other parts of the country looking to advance their
  positions.

[[player-guide.library,{library}]]{library}::
  Adjacent to the <<player-guide.law_uni>> rises the nation's premier repository
  of knowledge. From modern research journals to ancient folklore, the {library}
  provides access to an enormous wealth of information at no cost. The
  glossterm::[{library_staff}, {library_staff}] of the library work tirelessly
  to expand and preserve the collection, and are often seen moving like ghosts
  through the book stacks.
  
[[player-guide.police_hq,{police_hq}]]{police_hq}::
  The headquarters of the glossterm::[{police}, {police}] is a sharp building
  supported by thick columns of polished stone which stand vigil along its
  perimeter. The majority of citizens will only ever enter the public offices
  and temple of Iomedae within the structure. It is well known, however, that
  the {police_hq} also conceals a well-guarded network of armories, archives,
  and barracks.
  
{emperor_home}::
  Lush, tall gardens and a host of guards keep this gleaming marble estate
  private and safe. Despite its seclusion from the public eye, even here the
  Emperor cannot escape the responsibilites of his position. A direct view to
  the <<player-guide.law_city_capitol>> cuts through the manor's grounds, in
  keeping with a law that decrees the Emperor's bed must always face the
  capitol, such that his duties will be his last sight before retiring and his
  first upon waking.
  
{law_city_residential_district}::
  {law_city_residential_district} caters to citizens who need or choose to spend
  their time between <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>> and other
  settlements. The area features modest, efficient housing and a large number of
  inns with convenient access to the major roads between
  <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>> and
  <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>> and
  <<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>>.
  
{law_city_politician_district}::
  Home to many of <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}'s>> powerful mercantile and
  political elite, the {law_city_politician_district} features lavish estates
  with secluded vistas onto the glossterm::[{valley_lake}, {valley_lake}].
  Tactically located near hotbeds of influence such as the
  <<player-guide.law_city_government_district>>, <<player-guide.law_uni>>, and
  <<player-guide.law_city_market_district>>, soirees and galas featuring the
  nation's most renowed often take place here.
  
[[player-guide.law_city_government_district,{law_city_government_district}]]{law_city_government_district}::
  The largest district in the city, the {law_city_government_district} contains
  the majority of <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}'s>> government buildings
  and centers of religious worship. Neat and orderly even under the weight of
  the thousands working here, this district could almost be considered a
  settlement of its own within the city. Businesses of all types have been built
  to support the district's employees, ensuring they are well provided for as
  they toil for the good of the nation.
  
{law_city_plaza_district}::
  The {law_city_plaza_district} is filled with open gardens and other areas for
  public gatherings. This district lies in contrast with the purposeful feeling
  that pervades the rest of <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>>, providing
  residents and visitors with an escape from unending the rush of the city.
  
[[player-guide.law_city_market_district,{law_city_market_district}]]{law_city_market_district}::
  This district houses the city's harbors, markets, and enterprises like the
  <<player-guide.merchant_guild_hq>>. Busy at all times of day and night, goods
  endlessly flow through wide streets for sale, storage, and evaluation.

      <title>Barbarians</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      The civilized and well-kept lands of the nation are inhospitable to barbarian tribes. There are no
      naturally occurring tribes in this area, so any barbarians who have come to the country have come
      from elsewhere. Incivility and brutishness are frowned upon universally across the country, and
      many barbarians will find it a challenge to be welcomed or fit in.

      <title>Bards</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      A bard always has a place in the central cities, even if most do choose to settle in Oblectant. The
      musical college and The Dragon's Teeth provide everlasting opportunities for a bard to prove his
      worth and make a name for himself. In other cities, bards often put on a friendly face as the
      frontmen for guilds and political organizations. Outside of the cities few bards settle, but the
      outlying towns always have a need for entertainment, and there are frequently wandering minstrels
      who pass through.

      <title>Clerics</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Clerics of all the civilized gods are welcome in the nation, but clerics of Abadar will find 
      themselves particularly at home here. Aside from their religious duties, clerics are most frequently
      found in positions of political power. In particular, members of the senate are always clerics who
      are appointed by the churches of the nation. Clerics of any civilized deity will find a place in the
      central cities. Clerics of law or commerce may prefer Regunt, while clerics of the wilds or the more
      base pleasures may find Oblectant more to their liking.

      <title>Druids</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      As a shining example of civilization and urbanization, most druids avoid the central cities and the
      nation as a whole. However, the rich bounties of the land prove to some druids and insatiable 
      calling. Many of these druids do not wind up in the central cities, preferring instead to live in
      outlying towns and villages, but some do come into the more urban areas to provide guidance or
      ritualistic help for government endeavors which involve the land.

      <title>Fighters</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Whether as bodyguards or members of the national police force, a good fighter is always in need
      wherever he may be. There is no true military force in the nation, so very few fighters are proper
      soldiers. The natural borders of the country stave off foreign intrusion.

      <title>Monks</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Monks seeking purification and enlightenment through order and community may find themselves at home
      in the central cities. However, there are no official monk sects who call this nation their home.
      Despite this, martial prowess and spiritual leadership are valued traits both inside and outside
      the central cities, and a monk will not find themselves without employment for long.
    </para>

      <title>Paladins</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Although the nation was founded as a result of a crusade, it has grown so prosperous and successful
      that paladins are not seen as needed by national officials. However, because of the strong religious
      presence in the nation, many paladins still find themselves drawn here to advance their causes. A
      paladin should be cautious, however, as in the court room the nation's laws will always trump any
      conflicting religious edict.
    </para>

      <title>Rangers</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Rangers are abundant in the nation, but less frequently found in the central cities, save when they
      travel there to drop off good gathered from the wilderness or to seek out new hunts and bounties.
      Rangers who do choose to make a living in the city often do so as members of the police or as
      privately employed bounty hunters. In outlying areas, a ranger will find many places to call his 
      home.

      <title>Rogues</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Although central cities are lawful and safe places, a rogue's talents are nonetheless very useful to
      the elite of the cities. Merchants and politicians alike can always find a use for someone with
      quick hands and silent feet. Outside the central cities, non-criminal rogues are less common and
      most frequently make their livings as trappers or hunters.
    </para>

      <title>Sorcerers</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Sorcerers may not benefit from the vast libraries and universities of the nation, but they may still
      enjoy its wild atmospheres and opportunities provided here. Sorcerers with the skill for panache and
      performance may find themselves drawn to Oblectant, while those who wish to put their magical 
      abilities to use to further their own wealth or careers may find Regunt or Crent more to their 
      liking.
    </para>

    <info>
      <title>Wizards</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      The vast libraries and combined cultural knowledge of the central cities are a great resource to
      many wizards, and none will struggle to find employment here. Whether as part of a merchant's 
      retinue as an appraiser of magical goods or a craftsman in his own right, magical talent is always
      useful in the nation.

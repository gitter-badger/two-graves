      <title>Barbarians</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      The civilized and well-kept lands of &nation_name; are inhospitable to barbarian tribes. 
      Barbarism and brutishness are frowned upon universally across the country, and
      many barbarians will find it a challenge to be welcomed or to fit in. As there are no
      naturally occurring tribes in the valley, most barbarians trace their origins elsewhere on the
      continent. In particular, they thrive in the blazing sands of &desert_kingdom; and
      in the gladiatorial pits of &cliffs_nation;. 
    </para>
    <para>
      In &desert_kingdom;, fire-blooded &firepeople; are the warriors of nomadic tribes who roam 
      the desert, never staying in one place for too long as they consider it their duty to 
      safeguard their home and its culture. Though they may feel the bloodlust of battle, many are 
      pragmatists and some fund the efforts of their tribes by working as mercenaries. Others 
      may be outcasts or seekers of gold and glory looking to start a new life in a land different 
      from what they have known.
    </para>
    <para>
      &cliffs_nation_person; barbarians frequently rise to great ranks in the warrior culture of 
      their homeland. There, where power and determination are revered, barbarians can live akin to
      nobility. However, feats of greatness must be constantly proven, and one can only rise so
      high without a worthy tale of one's own. To this end, many leave &cliffs_nation; to
      travel the continent in search of fame and honor. But for each glorified warrior, there are 
      many defeated ones in his wake, and some among them are barbarians looking to redeem their 
      names in a new land.

      <title>Bards</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      As a cultural capital, &nation_name;&mdash;and in particular the central cities&mdash;holds 
      performance and entertainment in high esteem and demand. One of the central cities, 
      &arts_city;, is completely dedicated to the betterment and enjoyment of the arts, and any
      performer, new or veteran, will find opportunity there. From frenetic street festivals, to
      the studious halls of &arts_college;, to the crystalline elegance of the &amphitheater; 
      amphitheater, there is
      no limit to the passions of &arts_city;'s citizens. This intensity has even
      produced a saying known throughout the nation: no great performer will forever die so long as 
      there is music in &arts_city;. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Even outside of &arts_city;, a performer has many opportunities to excel. Politicians, 
      storeowners, and merchant guilds are all keenly aware of the impact a charismatic face can
      have on one's audience, and many seek the services of skilled spokesmen. Travelers, far
      from their homes, find comfort in local song and art even in a land so distant. And a rural
      life may become grim indeed without wanderers who tell tales or sing songs of grand 
      excitement and adventure.

      <title>Clerics</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      &nation_name; was founded as part of an Abadarian religious crusade, and its roots are still 
      apparent to this day. Although the nation is not strictly aligned with any one deity, its 
      senate is composed of eighteen representatives from the most influential temples &mdash;be it
      influence through number of worshipers, wealth, or other means. Currently the temples of 
      Abadar, Shelyn, Cayden Cailean, Sarenrae, Pharasma, Iomedae, and Erastil hold senate 
      positions. The temple of Abadar has maintained major power in the city, and from the gilded
      halls of &abadar_temple; in &law_city; it oversees much of the nation's financial and legal
      well-being. Shelyn and Cayden Cailean both have large followings in &arts_city;, and their 
      temples&mdash;&shelyn_temple; and &cc_temple;&mdash;draw tourists and worshippers from
      far and wide.
    </para>
    <para>
      Iomedae's temple is the &police_hq; in &law_city; and much of the police force are devotees.
      Sarenrae, Pharasma, and Erastil enjoy large popular support from all around the nation for
      their public services and good works, but they do not maintain large shrines or temples in
      any one location. Many other faiths have worshippers in &nation_name;, and although they do 
      not hold prominent political power, Desna, Gozreh, Calistria, and Irori all have noteworthy 
      followings in various places around the country.

      <title>Druids</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      As a shining example of civilization and urbanization, most druids avoid the central cities and the
      nation as a whole. However, the rich bounties of the land prove to some druids an insatiable 
      calling. Many of these druids do not wind up in the central cities, preferring instead to live in
      outlying towns and villages, but some do come into the more urban areas to provide guidance or
      ritualistic help for government endeavors which involve the land.

      <title>Fighters</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Whether as bodyguards or members of the national police force, a good fighter is always in need
      wherever he may be. There is no true military force in the nation, so very few fighters are proper
      soldiers.

      <title>Monks</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Monks seeking purification and enlightenment through order and community may find themselves at home
      in the central cities. However, there are no official monk sects who call this nation their home.
      Despite this, martial prowess and spiritual leadership are valued traits both inside and outside
      the central cities, and a monk will not find themselves without employment for long.

      <title>Paladins</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Although the nation was founded as a result of a crusade, it has grown so prosperous and successful
      that paladins are not seen as needed by national officials. However, because of the strong religious
      presence in the nation, many paladins still find themselves drawn here to advance their causes. A
      paladin should be cautious, however, as in the court room the nation's laws will always trump any
      conflicting religious edict.
    </para>

      <title>Rangers</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Rangers are abundant in the nation, but less frequently found in the central cities, save when they
      travel there to drop off goods from the wilderness or to seek out new hunts and bounties.
      Rangers who do choose to make a living in the city often do so as members of the police or as
      privately employed bounty hunters. In outlying areas, a ranger will find many places to call his 
      home.

      <title>Rogues</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Although the central cities are lawful and safe places, a rogue's talents are nonetheless very useful to
      the elite of the cities. Merchants and politicians alike can always find a use for someone with
      quick hands and silent feet. Outside the central cities, non-criminal rogues are less common and
      most frequently make their livings as trappers or hunters.

      <title>Sorcerers</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Sorcerers may not benefit from the vast libraries and universities of the nation, but they may still
      enjoy its wild atmospheres and the opportunities provided here. Sorcerers with the skill for panache and
      performance may find themselves drawn to &arts_city;, while those who wish to put their magical 
      abilities to use to further their own wealth or careers may find &law_city; or &market_city; more to their 
      liking.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <info>
      <title>Wizards</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      The vast libraries and combined cultural knowledge of the central cities are a great resource to
      many wizards, and none will struggle to find employment here. Whether as part of a merchant's 
      retinue, as an appraiser of magical goods, or a craftsman in his own right, magical talent is always
      useful in the nation.

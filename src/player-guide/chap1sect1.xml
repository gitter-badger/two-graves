    <title>Modern Life in &nation_name;</title>

  <para>
    In the heart of the valley of &valley_name;, protected by the forboding &mountain_range; to 
    the north and the unfathomable &rift; to the south, &nation_name; echoes with 
    a clarion call of opportunity. Low, rolling hills stretch across the
    landscape, and lush green forests intermingle with networks of towns and villages. 
    Occasionally, gleaming cities sit at the center of these networks, marking the terrain
    with intricate webs of road that connect settlements for miles around. Along the foothills of
    the &mountain_range;, frontier towns dot lands carved with snow-melt rivers that
    from the peaks above to empty into &valley_lake;.

    The abundance of the valley may provide, but ultimately the people of &nation_name; are its 
    lifeblood. Most citizens live and work in ostensibly simple villages, where they develop
    arable land and pull forth rich resources from the valley's mines. Their harvests flow
    inward toward the cities of the nation, where they supply insatiable craftsmen and 
    merchants who give &nation_name; its reputation as an economic and cultural superpower. In 
    return, the inner settlements provide ample public works, education, infrastructure, and other
    resources that allow the outland residents to specialize and thrive. All the while, brave
    and resourceful frontiersmen pave the way for others to follow in their footsteps and expand 
    the glory of the nation.

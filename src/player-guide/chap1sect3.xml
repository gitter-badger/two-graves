    <title>The Government of &nation_name;</title>
  </info>
  <para>
    Outwardly, the government of &nation_name; is composed of three parts: an Emperor, a Senate,
    and &HoRs;. The Emperor is an elected official rather than a supreme ruler. There is no term
    limit for an Emperor, but most choose to rule for twenty to twenty five years before stepping
    down. The Emperor holds the power to veto laws, act as the commander of the &police;, and
    resolve tie votes in the Senate. The current Emperor is &emperor;.
  </para>
  <para>
    The Senate comprises eighteen leaders chosen from and by the
    nation's eminent temples, with each temple holding a number of positions corresponding 
    to their influence. Senators are solely responsible for ratifying laws, and they also have 
    the power to call for an immediate re-election of the Emperor. &HoRs; are officials elected
    every four years by the citizens of their districts. Legally, the &HoRs; have only three 
    powers: they elect the Emperor from one of their own, they are the only citizens, besides the
    Emperor, permitted to directly address a meeting of the Senate, and they may vote to forcibly
    remove Senators from office for life.

      <title>Who's in the Senate?</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Currently, the temple of Abadar is allocated eight senate seats. Shelyn holds three, and
      Sarenrae and Cayden Cailean each hold two. Pharasma, Iomedae, and Erastil are all 
      represented, but each holds only one seat.

  <para>
    In practice, of course, the government is much more than just the sum of its leadership. Of the various 
    agencies and divisions that constitute the government, the largest
    and most publicly visible are the &police;, the &customs_dept;, and the &public_works;. The &police; 
    is charged with maintaining peace and safety 
    throughout the nation, and is the closest thing &nation_name; has to a military force. The current 
    head of police, &police_head;, continues to uphold the organization's
    excellent reputation, and although he may claim that they are chronicly understaffed and underfunded, 
    &nation_name; is an incredibly safe country. The &customs_dept; controls and maintains the magical gates
    that lead to &nation_name;, and are also responsible for levying taxes on exported goods. The &public_works;
    builds and maintains infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and waterways, and also settles disputes over
    public lands, most frequently regarding the ancient relics scattered about the country.

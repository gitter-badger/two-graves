=== Character Traits


Character traits are short summaries about your character's history,
motivations, or personality. They provide a few quick blurbs about overarching
concepts for your character, and reward you with mechanical benefits for
defining these concepts. In addition to providing you, the player, with ideas
they also serve to help other players and the GM understand each other and how
the party might integrate.


You may choose two character traits at the start of the scenario. You may not
choose the same trait twice. Combat, Equipment, Faith, Magic, Race, Regional,
Religion, and Social traits are not listed in this guide and should be taken
from other material if you wish to use them. This guide defines only Campaign
traits.


In addition to your character traits, your party should also work together to
establish a preexisting connection between your character and at least one other
party member. Try to spread out these connections as much as possible between
the members of the group. This will give the group a level of cohesion and
reason for sticking together rather than working alone. Remember, you can always
ask your GM for assistance with establishing traits and bonds between
characters.

==== Campaign Traits


Campaign traits are character traits that are guaranteed to be integrated with
some part of the scenario's storyline. They provide you with a surefire way to
tie your character into the story and seed your thoughts with ideas for
character motivation and history. To accomplish this, they are much more
prescriptive than other types of traits. You do not have to choose a campaign
trait as one of your two character traits, but if you don't you should be sure
to discuss your character with your GM so that she can plan out how to involve
your character with the story.

It bears repeating that no matter what traits you choose, you should always
strive to establish an existing connection with at least one other character in
the party before play begins. Campaign traits are a fast and effective way to do
this, but are not the only way.

===== Attacked by Gnolls

You were attacked by a band of gnolls recently in your life, and now you harbor
a deep, burning hatred for the monsters. Perhaps your village was ransacked, and
though you were not killed{mdash}due to either resourcefulness or maybe blind
luck{mdash}many of your friends and loved ones were. Or perhaps your caravan was
attacked on the road and you lost your belongings or close companions to the
gnollish bandits. Whatever the situation, you've had something dear stripped
from you, and your dreams are haunted by cackles and barks in the night. You've
sworn to yourself that no Gnoll will escape from you alive from this day on, and
you've taken to studying them with malicious fervor.

You may choose one of the following trait bonuses:

* You receive a +2 trait bonus to Perception checks made to keep watch.

* Add Abyssal (cannot speak) and Gnollish to your list of languages.

===== Shadows of the Past

Someone, or multiple people, dear to you have been forcibly taken away before
your eyes by sinister figures in dark cloaks. They may have come during the
night and burst into your home, or their actions may have taken place in a
secluded area in broad daylight. Wherever you were, they were very careful to
simply prevent you from disrupting them rather than kill you or abduct you as
well. The police have found no leads for your claim, and since that moment, you
have not seen nor heard of those who were taken. You haven't given up, though,
and recently you have turned up rumors that others have gone missing as well.

You may choose one of the following trait bonuses:

* You receive a+1 trait bonus to all saving throws against fear spells and
effects when an ally within 30 feet is threatened.

* Pick one of the following skills: Knowledge (local), Diplomacy, Intimidate,
Disguise, or Sense Motive. You receive a +1 trait bonus to that skill, and that
skill is considered a class skill for you.

===== Driven Out of Business

You once had a profitable enterprise, but were driven out of business by a shady
competitor.  Your competitor sprang out of nowhere, and his store was unusually
well stocked and equipped. Word of it spread surprisingly quickly, and at the
same time so did rumors which tarnished your reputation. Your suppliers became
less and less reliable, and before long, even your most loyal customers had
stopped patronizing your business. The damage dealt to your image was so severe
that you have been unable to find any way to start again in the commercial
world. You're certain that this sleazy rival was involved in the destruction of
your fortune, but you haven't found any way to prove it yet.

You may choose one of the following trait bonuses:

* Pick either charms or compulsions. You receive a +1 trait bonus to all saving
throws against spells and effects of that type while you and your allies are not
in combat.

* Pick one of the following skills: Bluff, Disable Device, Linguistics, Sense
Motive, or Sleight of Hand. You receive a +1 trait bonus to that skill, and that
skill is considered a class skill for you.

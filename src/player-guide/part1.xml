      Here you will find information about &nation_name; and its major settlments that any 
      individual who lives in or has briefly researched the nation would know. Feel free to use 
      these sections to help build your characters and integrate them into the world.

      &nation_name; was founded roughly 450 years ago when crusaders from a temple of
      Abadar in &meadows_nation; embarked on a mission to colonize the region. They swore a 
      holy oath that the new nation would be an exemplar of civilation and glory for centuries to 
      come. At that moment, they founded the &crusade_org; and dedicated themselves to the cause of
      sharing this glory with the world. To that end, they established a means of constructing and
      linking &portals;&mdash;magical gates which can be used to travel to and from &nation_name;.
      Immigrants to the new nation were slow to come at first, but they did arrive. And as they 
      arrived, they founded successful new lives in the bountiful valley of &valley_name;. Word 
      spread, and the population of &nation_name; grew exponentially as people from all over the 
      continent came to investigate this new wonder and found their expectations exceeded. It was 
      not long before the fledling nation became the hub of luxury, trade, and travel that it is 
      today.

    <para>
      In the heart of the valley of &valley_name;, protected by the forboding &mountain_range; to 
      the north and the unfathomable &rift; to the south, &nation_name; echoes with 
      a clarion call of opportunity. Low, rolling hills stretch across the
      landscape, and lush green forests intermingle with networks of towns and villages. 
      Occasionally, gleaming cities sit at the center of these networks, marking the terrain
      with intricate webs of roads that connect settlements for miles around. Along the foothills of
      the &mountain_range;, frontier towns dot still-wild lands carved with snow-melt rivers that
      descend from the peaks above to empty into &valley_lake;.

      The abundance of the valley may provide, but ultimately the people of &nation_name; are its 
      lifeblood. Most citizens live and work in ostensibly simple villages, where they develop
      arable land and pull forth rich mineral resources from the valley's mines. Their harvests flow
      inward toward the cities of the nation, where they supply insatiable craftsmen and 
      merchants who give &nation_name; its reputation as an economic and cultural superpower. In 
      return, the inner settlements provide ample public works, education, infrastructure, and other
      resources that allow the outland residents to specialize and thrive. All the while, brave
      and resourceful frontiersmen pave the way for others to follow in their footsteps and expand 
      the glory of the nation.

Beginning to proofread and edit the player's guide. Starting with
the opening paragraphs by making it seem less like a formulaic
history textbook. Adding more active voice and trying to vary
sentence structure. Some sentences still seem too long, especially
near the end.

### Splitting apart the entities files more

Ugh. It's bad. It hurts to read. Don't look at it! I'm REALLY not
happy with this brief description of regunt's Plaza district, but
I need to finish these in order to feel that I can move on.

Something is better than nothing for now.

### Adding a brief description to the regunt commuter's district in PG

Not particularly happy with it, but here's a really dry description
of the commuter's district in Regunt for the player's guide.

### Removing Times New Roman as an HTML font option

Especially at higher resolutions or smaller sizes, Times doesn't
look particularly good to me on the web. I'll leave it as a print
font fallback for now, but I'm replacing the web font with
Georgia.

### Renaming some districts in Regunt for player's guide

Providing real names for the districts in Regunt for the player's
guide. Removing the University District, as it should probably
just be folded into the government district.

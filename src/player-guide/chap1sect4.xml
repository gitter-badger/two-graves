      Although they may not be specifically called out in these sections, you
      can expect most government agencies that deal with infrastructure to 
      have representation in all large settlements. This includes, but is not
      limited to, divisions such as the &police;, &public_works;, and other 
      servants of the common good.

      <title>&arts_city;, City of Arts</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Brimming with life and activity, the city of &arts_city; is the 
      veritable pulse of &nation_name;. Artists and entertainers from all 
      walks of life flock to the city to join in the cultural melting pot and
      experience the wealth &arts_city; has to offer. Anywhere is a stage, and
      revelry spills out into the streets, infusing the city with a constant 
      state of festivity. Each day could bring new celebrations replete with 
      performances and displays unlike any seen before it. As a result, 
      &arts_city; is a hot spot for tourists from around the world, and their
      presence ensures that there is plenty of gold to keep the entertainers
      at their antics. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Officials long gave up on imposing bureaucracy upon the citizens, and 
      now simply seek to ensure that the city runs smoothly from one 
      performance to the next. The last vestige of control the government 
      maintains over the celebrations is the &festival_agency;, which 
      stages city-wide festivals, schedules access to large venues such as 
      &stadium;, and provides publicity for ambitious performers. The &police; 
      patrols the streets, keeping the city safe for residents and tourists 
      alike, but their presence is understated and does not impinge on the 
      city's carefree atmosphere. Petty crime is uncommon, and offenders are 
      swiftly swept to the nearest police station or courthouse for judgement.
    </para>
    <para>
      Despite the apparent laissez-faire attitude of the government,
      &arts_city; is extremely well-maintained. Buildings of sturdy wood and
      cut stone stand strong against the neverending flow of residents, and
      paved streets make for easy transport around the city. Lights both
      magical and mundane line the streets and buildings, vying for the 
      attention of passersby. Even with messy tourists who care not for the 
      city's cleanliness, strong sewers and trash removal systems sweep away 
      the filth and leave the city ready for the festivities to continue.

              Rows of enormous amethyst crystals jutting from the entrance 
              give &arts_city;'s premier amphitheater it's name. Although its 
              appearance and sublime acoustics would suggest a man-made 
              structure, &amphitheater; is actually a naturally occurring
              geode phenomenon. Performing even once in the &amphitheater; is 
              the goal of many artists, and competition is fierce. The revered
              &auditioners; are the final elite arbiters of who will be graced
              by the stage.

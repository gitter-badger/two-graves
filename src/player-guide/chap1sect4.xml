    <para>
      Although they may not be specifically called out in these sections, you
      can expect most government agencies that deal with infrastructure to 
      have representation in all large settlements. This includes, but is not
      limited to, divisions such as the &police;, &public_works;, and other 
      servants of the common good.

      <title>&arts_city;, City of Arts</title>
    </info>
    <para>
      Brimming with life and activity, the city of &arts_city; is the 
      veritable pulse of &nation_name;. Artists and entertainers from all 
      walks of life flock to the city to join in the cultural melting pot and
      experience the wealth &arts_city; has to offer. Anywhere is a stage, and
      revelry spills out into the streets, infusing the city with a constant 
      state of festivity. Each day could bring new celebrations replete with 
      performances and displays unlike any seen before it. As a result, 
      &arts_city; is a hot spot for tourists from around the world, and their
      presence ensures that there is plenty of gold to keep the entertainers
      at their antics. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Officials long gave up on imposing bureaucracy upon the citizens, and 
      now simply seek to ensure that the city runs smoothly from one 
      performance to the next. The last vestige of control the government 
      maintains over the celebrations is the &festival_agency;, which 
      stages city-wide festivals, schedules access to large venues such as 
      &stadium;, and provides publicity for ambitious performers. The &police; 
      patrols the streets, keeping the city safe for residents and tourists 
      alike, but their presence is understated and does not impinge on the 
      city's carefree atmosphere. Petty crime is uncommon, and offenders are 
      swiftly swept to the nearest police station or courthouse for judgement.
    </para>
    <para>
      Despite the apparent laissez-faire attitude of the government,
      &arts_city; is extremely well-maintained. Buildings of sturdy wood and
      cut stone stand strong against the neverending flow of residents, and
      paved streets make for easy transport around the city. Lights both
      magical and mundane line the streets and buildings, vying for the 
      attention of passersby. Even with messy tourists who care not for the 
      city's cleanliness, strong sewers and trash removal systems sweep away 
      the filth and leave the city ready for the festivities to continue.

              Rows of enormous amethyst crystals jutting from the entrance 
              give &arts_city;'s premier amphitheater it's name. Although its 
              appearance and sublime acoustics would suggest a man-made 
              structure, &amphitheater; is actually a naturally occurring
              geode phenomenon. Performing even once in the &amphitheater; is 
              the goal of many artists, and competition is fierce. The revered
              &auditioners; are the final elite arbiters of who will be graced
              by the stage.

            <para>
              Vivid botanical gardens and serene marble galleries compose the
              nation's premier temple of Shelyn. The temple is built on the 
              edge of the city and situated near the &amphitheater; so that the 
              clergy may more easily tend to the amphitheater. Compared to the 
              intensity of the city, &shelyn_temple; is truly a sanctuary for 
              those who wish to reflect upon the spiritual impact of the arts.

            <para>
              &arts_college; is one of the world's most prestigious schools for 
              the fine arts, and a central location for both prospective students
              and tourists alike. Although its intimidating spires, sharply slanted
              rooftops, and aged stone walls cast an imposing shadow, they belie
              the energy within. Its campus buzzes jovially at all hours of the 
              day as some of the greatest creative geniuses from around the 
              globe hone their skills.

              Named for the carpet of small purple flowers that blooms in the 
              spring, the &stadium; is an expansive, open-air park and a prime
              location for many public events. Complete with several small 
              venues for performances as well as a large stadium, the 
              &stadium; boasts ample space and seating for tourists and citizens
              alike. Whether it be music, sports, or festivals, an event in the
              &stadium; is sure to be lively and draw a large crowd.

              Spanning the &arts_city_river; River and joining the east and west
              of &arts_city; together, the &bridge; is more than just an 
              important piece of infrastructure. Many bits of &arts_city; 
              culture have incoporated the &bridge;, from tossing flowers into 
              the river below for good luck to being a hotspot for watching
              fireworks. More practically, it's also a natural chokepoint for 
              traffic through the city and its wide stone path is filled with 
              street performers, each trying to take advantage of their captive 
              audiences.

              A large stone carving of a frothing mug adorns the facade of
              &arts_city;'s favorite temple to the god of drinking and 
              merriment. This multi-story wood and stone building radiates a 
              warmth and festivity that can be felt from blocks away. The temple 
              hosts a stage and doubles as both a comedy house and theater for 
              celebrations of bravey, and its walls reverberate with laughter
              and cheers. To the confusion of tourists and the amusement of 
              locals, the interior of the temple is themed as a bank.

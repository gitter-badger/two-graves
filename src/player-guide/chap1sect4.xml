      Although they may not be specifically called out in these sections, you
      can expect most government agencies that deal with infrastructure to

      Brimming with life and activity, the city of <link linkend="player-guide.nation.cities.arts_city">&arts_city;</link> is the 
      veritable pulse of <glossterm baseform="&nation_name;">&nation_name;</glossterm>. Artists and entertainers from all

      experience the wealth <link linkend="player-guide.nation.cities.arts_city">&arts_city;</link> has to offer. Anywhere is a stage, and
      revelry spills out into the streets, infusing the city with a constant 
      state of festivity. Each day could bring new celebrations replete with 
      performances and displays unlike any seen before it. As a result, 
      <link linkend="player-guide.nation.cities.arts_city">&arts_city;</link> is a hot spot for tourists from around the world, and their
      presence ensures that there is plenty of gold to keep the entertainers

      Officials long gave up on imposing bureaucracy upon the citizens, and 
      now simply seek to ensure that the city runs smoothly from one 
      performance to the next. The last vestige of control the government 
      maintains over the celebrations is the <glossterm baseform="&festival_agency;">&festival_agency;</glossterm>, which 
      stages city-wide festivals, schedules access to large venues such as 
      <xref linkend="player-guide.nation.cities.arts_city.poi.stadium"/>,
      and provides publicity for ambitious performers. The <glossterm baseform="&police;">&police;</glossterm> 
      patrols the streets, keeping the city safe for residents and tourists 
      alike, but their presence is understated and does not impinge on the 
      city's carefree atmosphere. Petty crime is uncommon, and offenders are 
      swiftly swept to the nearest police station or courthouse for judgement.

      Despite the apparent laissez-faire attitude of the government,
      <link linkend="player-guide.nation.cities.arts_city">&arts_city;</link> is extremely well-maintained. Buildings of sturdy wood and
      cut stone stand strong against the neverending flow of residents, and
      paved streets make for easy transport around the city. Lights both
      magical and mundane line the streets and buildings, vying for the 
      attention of passersby. Even with messy tourists who care not for the 
      city's cleanliness, strong sewers and trash removal systems sweep away 
      the filth and leave the city ready for the festivities to continue.

      The master craftsmen themselves are no pushovers either. Crafting guilds

      No space is wasted in thoroughfares large or small, as every bit of

      At the heart of <glossterm baseform="&nation_name;">&nation_name;</glossterm> is the nation's crown jewel: the
      capital city of <link linkend="player-guide.nation.cities.law_city">&law_city;</link>. Towering, gleaming buildings of marble
      and polished stone strike a grand vista for those who first
      lay eyes upon the city. Impressive grids of streets and avenues 
      bustle with activity, feeding the machine that runs the nation.
      At night, although the streets die down to dim illumination by
      heavy iron lamps, the work of the city does not cease. Buildings
      big and small come to life as interior lights shine through their
      windows, offering tantalizing hints at the ongoings within.

      almost caring. The city runs like clockwork, with each inhabitant 
      and agency fulfilling a purpose in a timely and efficient manner. 
      From the lowliest courier to the highest seats of government, 
      every citizen of <link linkend="player-guide.nation.cities.law_city">&law_city;</link> is devoted fully to their cause. To do
      otherwise would be to invite certain scorn and disdain from one's

      Just as each citizen is devoted to their tasks, so is the city itself

      agency houses its highest offices here in this locus of government power.
      Yet despite the proximity of government control, the city does not
      quake under the tyranny of authoritarianism. That the government
      serves its people is a well respected fact, and it is commonly
      understood that <link linkend="player-guide.nation.cities.law_city">&law_city;</link> only functions at the willing 
      compliance of its citizens.

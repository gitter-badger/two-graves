    <title>Religion in &nation_name;</title>
  </info>
  <para>
    &nation_name; was founded as part of an Abadarian religious crusade, and its roots are still 
    apparent to this day. Although the nation is not strictly aligned with any one deity, its 
    senate is composed of eighteen representatives from the most influential temples&mdash;be it
    influence through number of worshipers, wealth, or other means. Currently the temples of 
    Abadar, Shelyn, Cayden Cailean, Sarenrae, Pharasma, Iomedae, and Erastil hold senate 
    positions. The temple of Abadar has maintained major power in the city, and from the gilded
    halls of &abadar_temple; in &law_city; it oversees much of the nation's financial and legal
    well-being. Shelyn and Cayden Cailean both have large followings in &arts_city;, and their 
    temples&mdash;&shelyn_temple; and &cc_temple;&mdash;draw tourists and worshippers from
    far and wide.
  </para>
  <para>
    Iomedae's temple is the &police_hq; in &law_city; and much of the police force are devotees.
    Sarenrae, Pharasma, and Erastil enjoy large popular support from all around the nation for
    their public services and good works, but they do not maintain large shrines or temples in
    any one location. Many other faiths have worshippers in &nation_name;, and although they do 
    not hold prominent political power, Desna, Gozreh, Calistria, and Irori all have noteworthy 
    followings in various places around the country.

=== Modern Life in {nation_name}

In the heart of the valley of glossterm::[{valley_name}, {valley_name}],
protected by the forboding glossterm::[{mountain_range}, {mountain_range}] to
the north and the unfathomable glossterm::[{rift}, {rift}] to the south,
glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}] echoes with a clarion call of
opportunity.  Low, rolling hills stretch across the landscape, and lush green
forests intermingle with networks of towns and villages.  Occasionally, gleaming
cities sit at the center of these networks, marking the terrain with intricate
webs of road that connect settlements for miles around.  Along the foothills,
frontier towns dot lands carved with snow-melt rivers that flow from the peaks
above down into the glossterm::[{valley_lake}, {valley_lake}].

The abundance of the valley may provide, but ultimately the people of 
glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}] are its lifeblood.  Most citizens live 
and work in ostensibly simple villages. There they develop arable land and pull 
forth riches from the valley's mines.  Their harvests flow inward toward the 
cities of the nation, where they supply the insatiable craftsmen and merchants 
who give glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}] its reputation as an economic 
and cultural superpower.  In return, the inner settlements provide ample public 
works, education and infrastructure which allow the outland residents to 
specialize and thrive.  All the while, brave and resourceful frontiersmen pave 
the way for others to follow in their footsteps and expand the glory of the 
nation.

    According to national history, centuries ago the valley of <glossterm baseform="&valley_name;">&valley_name;</glossterm>
    was long uninhabited and widely thought to be a cursed land.
    Determined to break ground for civilization where all others had failed, Abadaran crusaders embarked on a mission to colonize the valley. 
    They swore a holy oath to build a shining metropolis that would last for centuries to come.
    From their effort and toil the nation of <glossterm baseform="&nation_name;">&nation_name;</glossterm> was born. 
    Spurred on by their success, they created the organization known as the <glossterm baseform="&crusade_org;">&crusade_org;</glossterm>
    and dedicated it to sharing <glossterm baseform="&nation_name;">&nation_name;'s</glossterm> glory with the world. 
    To that end, they established a means of constructing
    <glossterm baseform="&portals;">&portals;</glossterm>&mdash;magical gates used to travel to and from 
    <glossterm baseform="&nation_name;">&nation_name;</glossterm>.
    Immigrants to the new nation were slow to come at first, but they did arrive. 
    And as they arrived, they started successful new lives in the bountiful valley. 
    Word spread, and the population of <glossterm baseform="&nation_name;">&nation_name;</glossterm> 
    grew exponentially as people from all over the continent came to investigate this new wonder and found their expectations exceeded. 
    It was not long before the fledgling nation became the hub of luxury, trade, and travel that it is today.

    According to national history, centuries ago the valley of &valley_name; was long uninhabited and widely thought to be a cursed land.
    Determined to break ground for civilization where all others had failed, Abadaran crusaders embarked on
    a mission to colonize the valley. They swore a holy oath to build a shining metropolis that would last for centuries to come.
    From their effort and toil the nation of &nation_name; was born. Spurred on by their success,
    they created the organization known as the &crusade_org; and dedicated it to
    sharing &nation_name;'s glory with the world. To that end, they established a means of constructing
    &portals;&mdash;magical gates used to travel to and from &nation_name;.
    Immigrants to the new nation were slow to come at first, but they did arrive. And as they 
    arrived, they started successful new lives in the bountiful valley. Word 
    spread, and the population of &nation_name; grew exponentially as people from all over the 
    continent came to investigate this new wonder and found their expectations exceeded. It was 
    not long before the fledgling nation became the hub of luxury, trade, and travel that it is 
    today.

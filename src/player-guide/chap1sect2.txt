=== A Brief History of the Nation

According to national history, centuries ago the valley of
glossterm::[{valley_name}] was long uninhabited and widely thought to be a
cursed land.  Determined to break ground for civilization where all others had
failed, Abadaran crusaders embarked on a mission to colonize the valley.  They
swore a holy oath to build a shining metropolis that would last for centuries to
come.  From their effort and toil the nation of glossterm::[{nation_name}] was
born.  Spurred on by their success, they created the organization known as the
glossterm::[{crusade_org}] and dedicated it to sharing
glossterm::[{nation_name},{nation_name}'s] glory with the world.  To that end,
they established a means of constructing glossterm::[{portals},
{portals}]{mdash}magical gates used to travel to and from
glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}].  Immigrants to the new nation were
slow to come at first, but they did arrive.  And as they arrived, they started
successful new lives in the bountiful valley.  Word spread, and the population
of glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}] grew exponentially as people from
all over the continent came to investigate this new wonder and found their
expectations exceeded.  It was not long before the fledgling nation became the
hub of luxury, trade, and travel that it is today.

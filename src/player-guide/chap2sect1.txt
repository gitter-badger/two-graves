=== Races in {nation_name}

.Commonalities Across Races
***************************
Due to the high economic and entertainment specialties of glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}], it draws craftsman
and tourists from all over the world. Unless described otherwise, you can assume that almost
any race can be represented as either a craftsman or a tourist.

Futhermore, the nation of glossterm::[{cliffs_nation}, {cliffs_nation}] has no discrimination against any race so long as 
they can carry their weight in war. glossterm::[{cliffs_nation_person}, {cliffs_nation_person}] bodyguards, hunters, policemen, and 
members of any other profession that involves martial prowess can easily find employment in 
glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}] regardless of their racial background.
***************************

==== Humans 

Humans are the dominant race in the central cities and in the nation at large, despite the 
generally high levels of diversity in the country. Humans native to glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}]
are represented in all professions, and tend to hold the majority of influential positions 
both in the economic and political spheres. They can be found in every major city and in the
outlying areas of the country.

Humans hailing from other parts of the continent tend to come to glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}] for
more specialized reasons. Farmers, clerics on pilgrimage, and visiting aristocrats from 
glossterm::[{meadows_nation}, {meadows_nation}] are all common sights. The goat-riding glossterm::[{mountainmen}, {mountainmen}] 
from the peaks of glossterm::[{mountains_nation}, {mountains_nation}]
are more rare, but sometimes come down to the valley for supplies or when they are seeking
lesser or perhaps even greater solitude than they found among their people in the mountains.
The exotic glossterm::[{firepeople}, {firepeople}] from neighboring glossterm::[{desert_kingdom}, {desert_kingdom}] are often employed as guides and 
laborers, although some have left their homes to make a living as performers in <<player-guide.nation.cities.arts_city,{arts_city}>>.
Humans from glossterm::[{forest_nation}, {forest_nation}] are significantly more rare, but occasionally a prodigy from the 
mage's academy or a wayward druid will make an appearance.

==== Dwarves

Because of the rich underground resources in the country, dwarves are frequently drawn here.
Most dwarves hail from the mountains in glossterm::[{mountains_nation}, {mountains_nation}] to live with their bretheren in the 
large network of dwarven homes that have been built under the earth. Although most dwarves
will be living in the outlying areas of the nation, many certainly do find their way to
the central cities. 

Most dwarves will find <<player-guide.nation.cities.market_city,{market_city}>> to their liking, as the ever-open markets and vendors 
offer a great opportunity to sell their wares and find rare materials. Some dwarves with an 
eye for government or leadership settle in <<player-guide.nation.cities.law_city,{law_city}>> and take a post in a guild 
or legal office. Dwarves in the legal realm tend to put their strong racial loyalties to use
defending the interests of other dwarves, and as such many find their way into positions as 
District Representatives. Dwarves rarely tend to have the patience for as wild a city as
<<player-guide.nation.cities.arts_city,{arts_city}>>.

==== Elves

Elves do come to the central cities in some numbers, but are rarely found elsewhere the nation.
Drawn by the wealth of craftsmanship and artistic talent, elves come to display their own prowess
and compare their works to other master artisans'. Because of this, most elves make their home in
a de-facto elven district in <<player-guide.nation.cities.market_city,{market_city}>>, where they can live in a manner closer to home while still 
reaping the advantages of the city. Elves almost never bother with the political and mercantile
business that takes place in <<player-guide.nation.cities.law_city,{law_city}>>, but sometimes are drawn to the lively music and performances
in <<player-guide.nation.cities.arts_city,{arts_city}>>.

Most of the elves living in glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}] hail from from glossterm::[{forest_nation}, {forest_nation}], and those that are 
not craftsmen are most often artists or performers, members of the mage's academy, druids, 
rangers, or clerics of Shelyn. 

==== Gnomes

The constant festivites and general excitement of <<player-guide.nation.cities.arts_city,{arts_city}>> are perfectly suited to the typical
gnome's demeanor. There they delight in taking part in or simply watching performances. While some
rise to great heights in official groups, most gnomes find great pleasure in being street performers
or vendors. Gnomes with an eye for business or a craving for the excitement of mercantile 
enterprises will sometimes venture into <<player-guide.nation.cities.market_city,{market_city}>> to try their luck there.
<<player-guide.nation.cities.law_city,{law_city}>> is far too boring and rigid for the majority of Gnomes, and they are rarely seen
there.

==== Halflings

Halflings dovetail with ease into the hubbub and excitement of the central cities, and
they can be found in great numbers all over the country. 
Artisans, shopkeepers, performers, and even occasionally politicians, a glossterm::[{nation_person}, {nation_person}] 
halfling's upbeat and amiable attitude is a formidable asset.

Halflings coming from glossterm::[{meadows_nation}, {meadows_nation}] are often members of the merchant class, seeking 
potential business partners. The rural, hill-giant loving halflings from glossterm::[{mountains_nation}, {mountains_nation}]
are more likely to become farmers in the outskirts of the nation.

==== Half-Elves

Half-elves face no discrimination for their mixed origin in any of the central cities, where diversity
is welcome and omnipresent. Because of this welcoming environment, half-elves have flourished in
the region and many travel from distant lands to come here. They are the second most populous
race in glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}]. Here, their mixed origin plays to their
advantage, and they are well suited to any role. However, many heed the call of their
elven side and find themselves as either artisans in <<player-guide.nation.cities.market_city,{market_city}>> or performers in <<player-guide.nation.cities.arts_city,{arts_city}>>.

==== Half-Orcs

Although diversity is welcomed in the central cities, brutishness and crassness are not. Although not
hated or feared by any means, most half-orcs simply do not fit into the lifestyle of these cities,
and so choose instead to live in the outlying towns and villages of the nation. Those who do choose
to live the cities tend to make their living as bodyguards for wealthy politicians or merchants, or
as a part of the police force.

=== Races in {nation_name}

.Commonalities Across Races
***************************
Due to the high commercial and entertainment specialties of 
glossterm::[{nation_name}], it draws craftsman and tourists from all over the 
world. Unless described otherwise, you can assume that almost any race can be 
represented as either a craftsman or a tourist.

Futhermore, the nation of glossterm::[{cliffs_nation}] does not discriminate 
against any individual so long as she can carry her weight in war. 
glossterm::[{cliffs_nation}, {cliffs_nation_person}] bodyguards, hunters, 
policemen, and members of any other profession involving martial prowess can 
easily find employment in glossterm::[{nation_name}] regardless of their racial 
background.
***************************

==== Humans 

Despite the generally high levels of diversity in the country, humans are the 
dominant race in the <<player-guide.central_cities, Central Cities>> and in the 
nation at large. Humans native to glossterm::[{nation_name}] are represented in 
all professions, and tend to hold the majority of influential positions in both 
the economic and political spheres. They can be found in every major city and in 
almost every outlying area of the country.

Humans hailing from other parts of glossterm::[{continent_name}] tend to come to 
glossterm::[{nation_name}] for more specialized reasons. Farmers, clerics on 
pilgrimage, and visiting aristocrats from glossterm::[{meadows_nation}] are all 
common sights. The goat-riding glossterm::[{mountainmen}] from the peaks of 
glossterm::[{mountains_nation}] are more rare, but sometimes come down to the 
valley for supplies or to seek lesser, or perhaps even greater, solitude than 
they find among their people in the mountains. The exotic 
glossterm::[{firepeople}] from neighboring glossterm::[{desert_kingdom}, 
{desert_kingdom}] are often employed as guides and laborers, although some leave 
their homes to make a living as performers in 
<<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>>. Humans from glossterm::[{forest_nation}] 
are significantly more rare, but occasionally a prodigy from the forest's mage 
academy or a wayward druid will make an appearance.

==== Dwarves

glossterm::[{nation_name}] is ripe with rich underground resources, and as a 
result dwarves are frequently drawn here. Most dwarves hail from the mountains 
in glossterm::[{mountains_nation}] where they once lived with their fellow 
bretheren of the glossterm::[{dwarf_queen}]. Once here, they tend to prefer life 
in the large network of dwarven homes that have been built under the earth. 
Although most dwarves will be living in the outlying areas of the nation, many 
certainly do find their way to the 
<<player-guide.central_cities, Central Cities>>.

Many dwarves will find <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>> to their 
liking, as the ever-open markets and vendors offer a great opportunity to sell 
wares and find rare materials. Some dwarves with an eye for government or 
leadership settle in <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>> and take a post in a 
guild or legal office. Dwarves in the legal realm tend to put their strong 
racial loyalties to use by defending the interests of other dwarves. 
Consequently, many find their way into positions as glossterm::[{HoRs}]. Dwarves 
rarely tend to have the patience for as wild a city as 
<<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>>.

==== Elves

Elves are rarely found in glossterm::[{nation_name}] outside of the 
<<player-guide.central_cities, Central Cities>>.  Drawn by the wealth of 
craftsmanship and artistic talent, elves come to display their own prowess and 
compare their works to other master artisans'. Because of this, most elves make 
their home in the <<player-guide.elven_enclave,de-facto elven district>> in 
<<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>>. There they can live in a familiar 
manner while still reaping the advantages of the city. Elves almost never bother 
with the political and mercantile business that takes place in 
<<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>>, but are frequently drawn to the lively 
music and performances in <<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>>.

Most of the elves living in glossterm::[{nation_name}] hail from from 
glossterm::[{forest_nation}], and those that are not craftsmen are most often 
artists, performers, members of glossterm::[{forest_nation}]'s mage's academy, 
druids, rangers, or clerics of Shelyn.

==== Gnomes

The constant festivites and general excitement of 
<<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>> are perfectly suited to the typical 
gnome's demeanor. While some rise to great heights in famous troupes, most 
gnomes find great pleasure in being street performers and vendors. Gnomes with 
an eye for business or a craving for the excitement of commercial enterprises 
will sometimes venture into <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>> to try 
their luck. <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>> is far too boring and rigid for 
the majority of gnomes, and they are rarely seen there.

==== Halflings

Halflings can be found in great numbers all over the country, but they dovetail 
with particular ease into the hubbub and excitement of the 
<<player-guide.central_cities, Central Cities>>.  Artisans, shopkeepers, 
performers, and even occasionally politicians, a glossterm::[{nation_name}] 
halfling's upbeat and amiable attitude is a formidable asset.

Halflings coming from glossterm::[{meadows_nation}] are often members of the 
merchant class seeking potential business partners. The rural, hill-giant loving 
halflings from glossterm::[{mountains_nation}] are more likely to become farmers 
in the outskirts of the nation.

==== Half-Elves

Half-elves have flourished in glossterm::[{nation_name}], especially in the 
<<player-guide.central_cities,Central Cities>> where diversity is practically 
omnipresent. They face next to no discrimination for their mixed origin, and 
many travel from distant lands to come here. Their integration has been so 
successful, in fact, that half-elves are now the second most populous race in 
glossterm::[{nation_name}]. Here, their dual cultures play to their advantage, 
and they are well suited to any role. However, many heed the call of their elven 
side and find themselves as either artisans or performers in 
<<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>>.

==== Half-Orcs

Although diversity is welcomed in the <<player-guide.central_cities,Central 
Cities>>, brutishness and crassness are not. Although not hated or feared by any 
means, most half-orcs simply do not fit into a metropolitan lifestyle, and so 
choose instead to live in the outlying towns and villages of the nation. Those 
who do choose to live in the cities tend to make their living as bodyguards for 
wealthy politicians or merchants, or as a part of the glossterm::[{police}].

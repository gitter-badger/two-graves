=== Races in {nation_name}

.Commonalities Across Races
***************************
Due to the high commercial and entertainment specialties of 
glossterm::[{nation_name}], it draws craftsman and tourists from all over the 
world. Unless described otherwise, you can assume that almost any race can be 
represented as either a craftsman or a tourist.

Futhermore, the nation of glossterm::[{cliffs_nation}] does not discriminate 
against any individual so long as she can carry her weight in war. 
glossterm::[{cliffs_nation}, {cliffs_nation_person}] bodyguards, hunters, 
policemen, and members of any other profession involving martial prowess can 
easily find employment in glossterm::[{nation_name}] regardless of their racial 
background.
***************************

==== Humans 

Despite the generally high levels of diversity in the country, humans are the 
dominant race in the <<player-guide.central_cities, Central Cities>> and in the 
nation at large. Humans native to glossterm::[{nation_name}] are represented in 
all professions, and tend to hold the majority of influential positions in both 
the economic and political spheres. They can be found in every major city and in 
almost every outlying area of the country.

Humans hailing from other parts of glossterm::[{continent_name}] tend to come to 
glossterm::[{nation_name}] for more specialized reasons. Farmers, clerics on 
pilgrimage, and visiting aristocrats from glossterm::[{meadows_nation}] are all 
common sights. The goat-riding glossterm::[{mountainmen}] from the peaks of 
glossterm::[{mountains_nation}] are more rare, but sometimes come down to the 
valley for supplies or to seek lesser, or perhaps even greater, solitude than 
they find among their people in the mountains. The exotic 
glossterm::[{firepeople}] from neighboring glossterm::[{desert_kingdom}, 
{desert_kingdom}] are often employed as guides and laborers, although some leave 
their homes to make a living as performers in 
<<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>>. Humans from glossterm::[{forest_nation}] 
are significantly more rare, but occasionally a prodigy from the forest's mage 
academy or a wayward druid will make an appearance.

==== Dwarves

glossterm::[{nation_name}] is ripe with rich underground resources, and as a 
result dwarves are frequently drawn here. Most dwarves hail from the mountains 
in glossterm::[{mountains_nation}] where they onced lived with their fellow 
bretheren of the glossterm::[{dwarf_queen}]. Once here, they tend to prefer life 
in the large network of dwarven homes that have been built under the earth. 
Although most dwarves will be living in the outlying areas of the nation, many 
certainly do find their way to the 
<<player-guide.central_cities, Central Cities>>.

Many dwarves will find <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>> to their 
liking, as the ever-open markets and vendors offer a great opportunity to sell 
wares and find rare materials. Some dwarves with an eye for government or 
leadership settle in <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>> and take a post in a 
guild or legal office. Dwarves in the legal realm tend to put their strong 
racial loyalties to use by defending the interests of other dwarves. 
Consequently, many find their way into positions as glossterm::[{HoRs}]. Dwarves 
rarely tend to have the patience for as wild a city as 
<<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>>.

==== Elves

Elves do come to the central cities in some numbers, but are rarely found
elsewhere the nation.  Drawn by the wealth of craftsmanship and artistic talent,
elves come to display their own prowess and compare their works to other master
artisans'. Because of this, most elves make their home in a de-facto elven
district in <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>>, where they can live in a
manner closer to home while still reaping the advantages of the city. Elves
almost never bother with the political and mercantile business that takes place
in <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>>, but sometimes are drawn to the lively
music and performances in <<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>>.

Most of the elves living in glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}] hail from
from glossterm::[{forest_nation}, {forest_nation}], and those that are not
craftsmen are most often artists or performers, members of the mage's academy,
druids, rangers, or clerics of Shelyn.

==== Gnomes

The constant festivites and general excitement of
<<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>> are perfectly suited to the typical
gnome's demeanor. There they delight in taking part in or simply watching
performances. While some rise to great heights in official groups, most gnomes
find great pleasure in being street performers or vendors. Gnomes with an eye
for business or a craving for the excitement of mercantile enterprises will
sometimes venture into <<player-guide.market_city,{market_city}>> to try their
luck there.  <<player-guide.law_city,{law_city}>> is far too boring and rigid
for the majority of Gnomes, and they are rarely seen there.

==== Halflings

Halflings dovetail with ease into the hubbub and excitement of the central
cities, and they can be found in great numbers all over the country.  Artisans,
shopkeepers, performers, and even occasionally politicians, a
glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_person}] halfling's upbeat and amiable
attitude is a formidable asset.

Halflings coming from glossterm::[{meadows_nation}, {meadows_nation}] are often
members of the merchant class, seeking potential business partners. The rural,
hill-giant loving halflings from glossterm::[{mountains_nation},
{mountains_nation}] are more likely to become farmers in the outskirts of the
nation.

==== Half-Elves

Half-elves face no discrimination for their mixed origin in any of the central
cities, where diversity is welcome and omnipresent. Because of this welcoming
environment, half-elves have flourished in the region and many travel from
distant lands to come here. They are the second most populous race in
glossterm::[{nation_name}, {nation_name}]. Here, their mixed origin plays to
their advantage, and they are well suited to any role. However, many heed the
call of their elven side and find themselves as either artisans in
<<player-guide.arts_city,{arts_city}>>.

==== Half-Orcs

Although diversity is welcomed in the central cities, brutishness and crassness
are not. Although not hated or feared by any means, most half-orcs simply do not
fit into the lifestyle of these cities, and so choose instead to live in the
outlying towns and villages of the nation. Those who do choose to live the
cities tend to make their living as bodyguards for wealthy politicians or
merchants, or as a part of the police force.

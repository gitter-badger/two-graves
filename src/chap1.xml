    <title>Setting the Scene</title>
    <para>
      Generations before the first crusading parties of Abadar came to found the nation of
      &nation_name;, the smaller, less prosperous kingdom of &old_nation_name; laid claim to the
      valley of &valley_name;. Content to utilize the valley's rich land to sustain themselves, the citizens of
      &old_nation_name; shared little contact with the neighboring desert kingdom of &desert_kingdom;, and their king
      held few ambitions for expansion. This isolationism would prove to be their undoing.
    </para>
    <para>
      While the people of &old_nation_name; happily labored within their small towns and hamlets, 
      barbarian nomads from the desert came to &valley_name; through the mountains. With these 
      barbarians came a young chieftan known as &barb_king;.

PCs should gain 4 levels off the gnolls

Two choices
===========

PCs can either use the map if they got it to find the gnollish outpost in the forest or they can 
pose as civilians and get captured.

Either way, there is a small gnollish outpost in the woods in the NW of the country. Not a whole 
army, but enough to be very dangerous. They're smart (cause merchants and cultists) so they move
frequently and haven't been caught yet. If the PCs don't use the capture method they will need to
trek through the woods (fighting stuff as they go) to get here.

First task: break out the hostages via either stealth or force (if they are capable of doing so).
Second task: wipe out the camp (after having achieved the requisite strength to do so).

After routing the camp, they explore the leader's tent to find several strange things:

- a map with big Xs over all the spots that the gnolls have massacred. 
- a map of the mountains to the north where the gnoll king is hiding out

gnolls might divulge secrets after torture

They find lots of other suspiciously good gear and spell components here.

Gnoll king
==========

Overview
--------

The gnoll king has taken up residence in the mountains on the north border of the country. He 
doesn't know it, but he's staying in the now abandoned layer of an old dragon who once lived there.
That dragon is the one who "killed" the lich king before he realized the truth of his condition. The
king of course also killed the dragon in the process. Eventually, he returned for the dragon's horde
to fund some of his vengeance-inspiring ventures. Nothing, save for a few small trinkets, leaves any
indication that this was once the layer of a dragon.

On the way up the mountains the PCs encounter some hillbillies. They are the far off descendents of
a group of people who worshipped the dragon who once lived in the mountain. The dragon merely 
tolerated his worshiper's presence so long as they were not in the way, and he never informed them
of his plans or actions. So one day when he just disappeared the worshipers did not know he had been
slain. They eventually left his caves and some of them settled in the forest here long ago. Every
day they would pray for the dragon to return. Over time, inbreeding and lack of education reduced
them into their current state. They no longer know anything about the dragon. They worship the 
mountain now, although they perform the same rites their ancestors did when praying to the dragon.
They have no clue what it all means; they're simply mimicking the motions and words that their
parents and their parents before them did.

PCs have to fight their way up the mountainside and then into the gnollish compound, and ultimately
to the king. They fight him, he reveals he had been put into power in exchange for his commanding
the gnolls to do the massacres in a specific way. He drops some hints about robed figures and
merchants giving them magic and gear.

The path to the king
--------------------

The gnolls have a special way of getting up and down the mountains. The 
merchants have procured for them a few giant shadow birds. These birds are
rare polar nocturnal hunters capable of carrying large baskets of gnolls. When
they fly, their feathers naturally exude a shadowy concealant, making them
basically invisible at night. They fly groups of gnolls back and forth from
the mountain. Finding their drop-zone results in seeing some gnoll tracks and a
couple very large rectangular markings.

In this way, the gnolls can easily adapt their attack strategy by simply
flying somewhere else.

Things to encounter on the way to the king
------------------------------------------

### The hillbillies

The hillbillies live near/in the foothills of the mountains in an ancient temple
once owned by their ancestors. The temple was not much even in its
prime, but is now in complete disrepair. Time and weather have worn it down to
nothing more than a shattered set of walls and partial roof above ground, and a
cave-like worship chamber below ground. The hillbillies themselves live in
small huts surrounding the temple.

The hillbillies ignorantly pantomime the rituals and words taught to them by
generations past. They worship the mountain now, having forgotten all traces of
the dragon, and their rituals---while distinctly draconic sounding---are 
completely garbled and nonsensical. 

Recently, however, they got something right. They unknowingly performed a 
draconic spirit summoning ritual during their daily prayer to the mountain in 
the temple's worship chamber. Of course, none of the hillbillies are capable of
controlling such a summoned spirit, and it drove them out of the worship 
chamber. They managed to seal it inside, but are distraught because they
cannot give worship to the mountain as instructed. They were definitely taught
the fear their ancestors had for what happened if you didn't give worship. They
don't know how to interpret the appearance of the spirit, and various theories
abound. "It's a ghost!", "The mountain is angry with us!", and "Someone malicious put it
there to harm the mountain!" are all popular theories.

If the party doesn't immediately attack the hillbillies, they will ask for
assisstance in clearing out the summoned spirit, but not before the paranoid
among the hillbillies suggests that maybe these adventurers put the spirit there
to begin with!

### The deaf giant

Geirbrand
"Giant" Cliff Giant

Somewhere deeper in the mountain pass is a plot of land owned by a cliff giant.
His name is Geirbrandr, and he has been deaf since a young age. He was able to
hear long enough to learn Giant, but no other languages. He can speak and read,
but not read lips and obviously not hear. Although he cannot hear, he still has 
his youthful habit of mumbling to himself in giant when he's annoyed.

Geirbrandr is very large for his people, and that coupled with his general
isolation and lack of formal education has given him the impression that
non-giant humanoid creatures are more or less in the same category as animals.
They're smarter and hurt a bit more than animals, but are mostly just a nuisance
that should be shooed away since they clearly don't know better.

When humanoids trapse through his lands, he'll try to harmlessly pick them up 
and gently toss them out of his gardens. If they resist he'll switch to 
nonlethal force to incapacitate intruders before removing them, grumbling to
himself all the while.

The quickest way to deal with Geirbrandr is to get on mounts and sprint through
his gardens. When humanoids do this it greatly annoys him, as it's roughly the
equivalent of a herd of dogs running through someone's flower garden, but he'll
just blow some smoke and fix the damage. This is how the gnolls have been 
getting past him.

If the party can somehow manage to befriend Geirbrandr, he will tell them the
direction that gnolls speed through his garden and will also show them a 
hidden route that will take them past the gnoll stronghold. This works 
especially well if Geirbrandr is placed near the end of the mountain pass.
If he's placed somewhere near the middle or beginning, the route will need to
have some other benefit.

### Treasure

- Daredevil boots
- 300 gp assorted jewelry
- 200 gp of quality, but not masterwork, assorted gear
- A spellbook containing: mending, open/close, ant haul, dancing lantern
- Bag of Nature's Travel

#### Bag of Nature's Travel

Aura moderate illusion; CL 7th
Slot ---; Price ; Weight ---;

This bag contains 3 pinches of a natural material such as leaves, sand, snow,
or water that allow the possessor and other creatures to travel under the guise
of a natural phenomenon. 

As a standard action the user may remove a pinch of the material from 
within the bag and toss it overhead. He and all creatures within 30 feet instantaneously
enter into an illusion of a natural phenomenon related to the material taken. 
For leaves this might be a small whirlwind filled with debris; for
sand, a sandstorm; for snow, a snowstorm or avalanche; and for water, a rushing
torrent. Conscious, unwilling creatures must make a DC 13 Will save to avoid 
being pulled into the effect. The illusion occupies a 60ft space centered on the
user. If a 60ft space is not available, the magic fails to activate.

While under the illusion of the phenomenon, all creatures are treated as having
a base speed of 80 and as under the effects of the following spells: 
feather step, feather fall, water walk, invisibility, and zone of silence. 
Regardless of the type of the phenomenon invoked, it can do no harm nor gains any
other properties related to how it appears. For example, a rock slide does not
crush creatures, a rush of water cannot batter down doors, and a snow storm cannot
slip through cracks.
 
Creatures with the ability to see through invisibility may target creatures within
the illusion. Creatures within the illusion are not denied any normal bonuses they
would receive against attacks or other effects.
 
Creatures in the illusion may take no actions but may communicate as normal.
The creature who tossed the material controls the movement of the illusion and all
creatures within. He may cease the effect at any time as a free action. Conscious
creatures within the illusion may make another DC 13 Will save each round to escape.
Succeeding on the Will save immediately ejects the creature from the illusion,
ending all related effects. Ejected creatures may not attempt to rejoin the
illusion.

The illusion lasts for 10 minutes, after which it and all related effects 
immediately end. Creatures are deposited in the same configuration as they were
when the effect began. The creature who tossed the material may toss another pinch
while the illusion is still in effect as a standard action. This will reset the 
duration of the illusion back to 10 minutes. All creatures within the illusion
may attempt another DC 13 Will save to escape. No new creatures may enter the
illusion when the material is used in this manner.

The bag can never hold more than 3 pinches of material, nor can it hold multiple
types of material at the same time. When new material is added to the bag, it
requires a week of charging time from the point it was added before the magic
can be used. The bag may be harmlessly emptied without activating it.

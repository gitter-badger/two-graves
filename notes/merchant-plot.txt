Hook 1: Facing Your Competition
===============================

Through investigation or confrontation, you finally find out more about the guy
who drove you out of business. Turns out he was never in your field to begin 
with. He was a fairly charming fellow who has hard on his luck and was given an
opportunity. Confronted by two shady business men, he was sold the idea that 
they needed someone to man a storefront. They would take care of all of the 
stocking, marketing, and other business, but they were too busy to actually
work the shop themselves. He has a "winning" attitude, so he seems like he would
be perfect. All he has to do is follow some basic instructions. In fact, those
dudes are mid-level thieves guild members, indirectly employed by the merchant's
guild. They use these fake storefronts to fence goods and launder money.

Your competition will eventually give up the details if confronted about it
harshly enough, or he can be tailed to a meeting with these guys.

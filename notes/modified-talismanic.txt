Modified Talismanic Components
==============================

New across the board rules
--------------------------

1. Crafters no longer need to be able to cast an item's prerequisite spells, if 
any. Instead, the crafter need only meet two conditions. This also applies when 
creating potions, spell-trigger, and spell-completion items. There is no 
increase to the DC of the Spellcraft check to create the item due to missing 
prerequisites, but if the crafter does not meet these conditions she cannot 
create the item.
    1. The crafter must have levels in a class which is capable of casting the 
same type of magic as classes which have the prerequisite spell on their 
spell list. 
    2. The crafter must be able to cast spells of the same level as the 
prerequisite spell. If the caster does not have the prerequisite spell on their 
spell list, they must be able to cast spells of a level that matches the 
highest level at which a class of their magic type adds the prerequisite spell 
to their spell list. If the crafter has levels in spellcasting classes for 
multiple types of magic, they may choose which type of magic to apply for this 
condition.
    3. If a crafter takes the Master Craftsman feat, they must choose a type of 
magic for the purposes of meeting these conditions. This choice cannot be 
changed.

2 options for creation
----------------------

It is up to GM discretion which of these options are available on a 
case-by-case basis.

### Quest for the Talismanic Components

A crafter can draw from latent magical energies which abound in certain 
scenarios and places in order to craft magic items. In doing so, they go on a 
quest to fulfill certain conditions necessary for crafting the item and in 
exchange pay no cost or a reduced cost for the creation of the item.

When crafting in this manner, the time needed to create the item is dependent 
on the conditions required by the Talismanic Components. The process may be 
instantaneous or require hours/days.

When crafting in this manner, the crafter does not need to make a Spellcraft 
check to complete the item. The item will always be created, but may result in 
a cursed item. To determine if this happens, make a Spellcraft check against 
the normal DC of the Spellcraft check to create the item minus 5. If the check 
fails, the resulting item is cursed.

If utilizing the Perks and Flaws rules for magic item creation, apply the 
Aberrant Mutation crafting challenge when creating the item in lieu of making 
the Spellcraft check. The results of the challenge affect the outcome of the 
crafting process.

Crafters may cooperate to meet the conditions necessary to craft the item if 
multiple types of magic are needed. However, all crafters must meet the 
conditions specified by the Talismanic Components.

### Purchase the Talismanic Components

A crafter may purchase, at the full price listed for crafting the item, 
materials sufficient to satisfy any Talismanic Components. When crafting in 
this manner, there is the possibility of failure. The crafter must make a 
Spellcraft check to complete the item. This check follows the normal rules, and 
can result in loss of materials and the need to start over or a cursed item. 
When crafting in this manner, time is required as per the standard magic item 
crafting rules. If multiple types of magic are required to create the item, 
multiple crafters may cooperate to meet the conditions necessary. In this case, 
only the primary crafter must succeed at the Spellcraft check to create the 
item. The other crafters are simply providing magical resources necessary 
to meet the conditions, and as such cannot assist on the Spellcraft check to 
create the item unless they possess the ability to do so via means such as the 
feat Cooperative Crafting.

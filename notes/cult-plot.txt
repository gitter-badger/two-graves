Hook 1: Seedy Bar
=================

Police reports do indeed show missing persons. Two most recent are missing from
Oblectant. It's the result of a seedy bar patron who is unknowingly working on
behalf of the cultists. He's super low on the totem poll. He thinks that he's
just a recruiter of low-lifes for illegal work. He has an arrangement with a 
couple other more malicious people who actually do the kidnapping and 
trafficking. He brings "prospects" to the sewers to meet with these people under
the premise that they are offering good money fast. He just assumes that they
go underground with their work, and that's why he never hears about them again.
He doesn't think about it too hard.

PCs will probably question their way to this guy, and then eventually follow him
somehow into the sewers, either when he has new prospects or as prospects 
themselves. This will lead them to the more malicious traffickers. This guy 
isn't dumb, though, and takes a lesser known, hard to follow, and possibly 
dangerous route through the sewers to the meeting point.

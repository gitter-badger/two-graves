Intermediary Hook: Getting Police Reports
=========================================

If the PCs don't have chief officer authorization, they cannot view the poice
reports at the Praesidium. Easiest way would be to work with Chief Amelia in
the gnoll plot line. Otherwise, you can work with Chief Donovan. His deal is 
that currently a lot of police are out in the field dealing with the gnolls, and
he needs a team to go into Oblectant. There's been reports of illegal gambling,
and they need to be arrested. The problem is that they almost always run, and
it's bad mojo to cause a scene in Oblectant. He needs some discreet people to
help chase down the gamblers and bring them to justice. At the end of it, he
may be willing to authorize viewing a few low-profile police reports.

The gamblers are in the sewer, but a different part of the sewer than the seedy
bar patron from the cult plot Hook 1. When confronted, they of course flee, and
the mission may become to track them down and bring them in from the city 
without disrupting the ongoing festival at the time.

Intermediary Hook: Verna's Father
=================================

On the way to the mountain pass, the group can come across a small band of
Vuori. 5 men in total. If Verna is with them, she'll break all cover and run up
to them. She'll start yelling during her approach if they've seen a Vuori with
a big red beard. Her voice trails off as they turn around and she notes that 3
of the 5 men have red beards of varying length.

She's looking for her father, a Vuori described by her mother as having
"the biggest red beard she'd ever seen, and missing a toe on his right foot."
Verna's mother died early in Verna's life and never told anyone her father's
name, for fear that her grandfather would try to go into the mountains and hunt
him down (a likely assumption).

The vuori here are smugglers. Their whole party consists of 8 men. 1 man was
their fur hunter who left the group some days ago to hunt down a leopard. He
is now, unbeknownst to them, dead. He too had a big red beard, but is not 
Verna's father.

The other two are going to pick up the cache they've been hired to smuggle out
of the country. They won't be back for some time, and the Vuori here aren't
going to leave without them. They're jumpy overall, being smugglers and whatnot,
but they are all genuinely concerned for Verna, and will truthfully agree to
help her if they aren't too pressured by the players. Verna will, of course,
want to go with them. 

Intermediary Hook: Observatory Hag
==================================

High-level summary:
- 50-80 years ago Desnan astronomers came into the mountains to found an 
observatory. They did it.
- They have a journal where they note that there are some kobolds living in ice
caves nearby. Not considered a threat, and they have "means of securing the
observatory if necessary."
- One day journal details the arrival of the hag
- Hag assaults observatory
- Astronomers secure the 2nd and 3rd floors using magic
- Hag gets in somehow, forces astronomers away/kills them
- Hag takes over observatory, enslaves kobolds
  - the kobolds were made arctic by the dragon that used to live in the 
  mountains. The hag ensorcelled/killed off all the old shamans and replaced
  their dogma with her own. no clues left about the dragon's involvement except
  notes from the astronomers that the kobolds were already arctic before the
  hag's arrival.

Astronomers had some nice stuff:
- (magical?) spyglass
- broken magical telescope. could be repaired and then allows you to see into
other planes
- other assorted loot

Journal and some loot is hidden behind a door that has a magical starmap on it.
The stars can be rearranged. Knowledge (religion) check recalls a Desnan folk
tail that recounts a poem of a race between man and a rabbit to determine which
creature would possess Desna's luck. Rabbit wins, that's why rabbits' feet are
lucky. Rearrange star map to form a rabbit = door open.

Intermediary Hook: Getting Police Reports
=========================================

If the PCs don't have chief officer authorization, they cannot view the poice
reports at the Praesidium. Easiest way would be to work with Chief Amelia in
the gnoll plot line. Otherwise, you can work with Chief Donovan. His deal is 
that currently a lot of police are out in the field dealing with the gnolls, and
he needs a team to go into Oblectant. There's been reports of illegal gambling,
and they need to be arrested. The problem is that they almost always run, and
it's bad mojo to cause a scene in Oblectant. He needs some discreet people to
help chase down the gamblers and bring them to justice. At the end of it, he
may be willing to authorize viewing a few low-profile police reports.

The gamblers are in the sewer, but a different part of the sewer than the seedy
bar patron from the cult plot Hook 1. When confronted, they of course flee, and
the mission may become to track them down and bring them in from the city 
without disrupting the ongoing festival at the time.

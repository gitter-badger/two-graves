Start of campaign
=================

The nation has a law that allows it to conscript its citizens into the national police exactly once
in their lifetime. For any PCs that wouldn't have volunteered to join this mission, this is the
reason why they are here.

PCs volunteer or get press ganged into helping evacuate an outlying village (Torvent). The reason for the
evacuation is that the national police have a hunch that the gnolls will be attacking this village
next. They believe that because they received a complaint from one of the farmers that a hyena had
killed a few of his sheep. Hyenas are not native to the country. Most of the evacuation goes without
issue but there are a few holdouts that the PCs need to deal with.

The point of this is to get the PCs to know each other and establish some contacts and a feel for
the nation and the outlying areas. The police aren't here in force because there are several other
potential target towns, so their forces are spread out. The plan is that the town will be evacuated
and then a body of officers will wait in ambush.

Main NPCs that need help:

- Old shepard
  - Name: Eustace
  - Appearance: Human male, bald with a big white beard and a floppy sun hat
  - Quirks: Likes to nickel and dime requests, has a loose grip on reality
  - old man who placed the original complaint about the hyenas. Has the following requests:
    - kill the hyena
      - CR 1 encounter w/ a hyena
    - help him get his sheep into the wagons to be evacuated (yeah right)
      - Diplomacy (DC 20, or 15 if a plan is devised to save some of the sheep),
        Bluff, Intimidate (DC 15), or other social manipulation. 
    - oh right his granddaughter is out in the woods gathering food

- druggie teen
  - Name: Tomas
  - Appearance: Human male, wiry with black hair and a scragly pseudo-beard
  - Quirks: Reads like an open book, shifty, tries too hard to appear "tough", prone to hero worship
  - suspicious youth who seeks out the most seedy PC and asks if they can help him. He has some 
    "stuff" that he recently bought from a traveling merchant and can't sneak it into his parent's
    luggage
      - Sleight of hand, and Stealth to conceal the "stuff." Bluff to get past
        other guards/parents. 

- superstitious man
  - Name: Felix
  - Appearance: Human male, Beer belly and balding, covered in charms and totems
  - Quirks: superstitious, easily persuaded, likes to think of himself as knowledgeable
  - superstitious villager who recently got a "bargain deal" on some "anti-evil spikes" that are
    supposed to keep evil influences away from buildings whose foundation they are driven into. He
    figured it was such a deal that he bought 20 when he only needed one. He also wants help putting
    up charms and wards around his house. Once that's done, he figures it's basically a fortress so
    he might as well stay, right?

- Inn keeper
  - Name: Cenbert
  - Appearance: Halfling male, brown braided, well-oiled hair and impeccably clean clothing
  - Quirks: Very proud, but a bit sneaky
  - man who built an inn/tavern and insured it with the nation. as part of that insurance, he has to
    fill out some paperwork which he wants to do before he evacuates. And he cares a lot about
    his inn so he takes great pains to point out the condition and rarity of _every_ single thing in
    his inn, and wants the police to recognize what he's saying. Of course, he's not above 
    embellishing the truth about the value of his inn.

- granddaughter
  - Name: Verna
  - Appearance: Human female, wears practical, well-worn hunter's attire
  - Quirks: Attached at the hip to her dog, independent to a fault, wants to return to the mountainmen
  - a 17 year old granddaughter of the old shepard. She's out hunting in the woods with her dog.
    She's perfectly capable, but the PCs don't necessarily know that, and she does have a penchant
    for staying out late--well past the deadline for evacuation.

Once the PCs have evacuated the remaining villagers (which should happen just a bit before 
nightfall), they load them up onto a couple wagons and head out. There are a couple police officers
who also stayed behind to guard the wagons as well. Along the way, gnolls appear on hyena-back from
out of nowhere. High perception would have seen a small duststorm approaching, then the wagon
passes behind a hill and suddenly the gnolls are right there.

Primary goals are to kill gnolls and protect the villagers. Gnolls aren't there specifically to kill
people yet, but to capture them for later sacrifice. They try to kidnap and make as much chaos as
possible. They try to light the wagons on fire, kill the wagon driver, steal the horses (not kill
because this pack of gnolls likes horse meat), and kidnap villagers from the wagons. there is a 
leader in the back of the pack barking battle tactics

Mitigations: kill hyena mounts, understand gnollish and hear battle tactics, extinguish fire,
expert driving through rough terrain, kill gnolls to force their retreat, incapacitate the leader, 
kill hostages that are taken.

When the gnolls make their retreat, they hide behind a nearby hill and teleport (out of sight) away,
disappearing as quickly and mysteriously as they arrived.

If the PCS do well: a letter is dropped by the pack leader from the camp seargent. It says basically
"gone for business, finish up our plans here and prepare the forest camp for movement."

After the gnolls leave and the caravan arrives in the town, the PCs are brought in for debriefing
with the local chief of police. This is their first opportunity to leave the gnoll plot line and
switch to one of the other main lines.

If any hostages were taken, the police chief has a few options available: if they got the map, offer
to reward the PCs handsomly if they track down the gnolls and retrieve the hostages. If they don't
have the map, then the chief has another idea: pose as civilians and become captured, then break
out from the inside. 

Switch to one of the other plot lines now depending on the choice made by the PCs.

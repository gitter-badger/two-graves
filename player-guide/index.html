a paragon of the virtuous, civilized world. From its highest peaks to its

forboding <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.11">Devil’s Tail Mountains</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_modern_life_in_seorsus.2.4"></a> to the north and the unfathomable
<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.20">Great Rift</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_modern_life_in_seorsus.2.6"></a> to the south— <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_modern_life_in_seorsus.2.8"></a> echoes with a
clarion call of opportunity.  Low, rolling hills stretch across the landscape,
and lush green forests intermingle with networks of towns and villages.
Occasionally, gleaming cities sit at the center of these networks, marking the
terrain with intricate webs of road that connect settlements for miles around.
Along the foothills, frontier towns dot lands carved with snow-melt rivers that
flow from the peaks above down into the <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.7">Clearlake</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_modern_life_in_seorsus.2.10"></a>.</p><p>The abundance of the valley may provide, but ultimately the people of
<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_modern_life_in_seorsus.3.2"></a> are its lifeblood.  Most citizens live
and work in ostensibly simple villages. There they develop arable land and pull
forth riches from the valley’s mines.  Their harvests flow inward toward the
cities of the nation, where they supply the insatiable craftsmen and merchants
who give <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_modern_life_in_seorsus.3.4"></a> its reputation as an economic
and cultural superpower.  In return, the inner settlements provide ample public
works, education and infrastructure which allow the outland residents to
specialize and thrive.  All the while, brave and resourceful frontiersmen pave
the way for others to follow in their footsteps and expand the glory of the
nation.</p></section><section id="player-guide.nat_history" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>A Brief History of the Nation</h3></header><p>According to national history, centuries ago the valley of
<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.29">Multae</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.nat_history.2.2"></a> was long uninhabited and widely thought to be a
cursed land.  Determined to break ground for civilization where all others had
failed, Abadaran crusaders embarked on a mission to colonize the valley.  They
swore a holy oath to build a shining metropolis that would last for centuries to
come.  From their effort and toil the nation of <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.nat_history.2.4"></a> was
born.  Spurred on by their success, they created the organization known as the
<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.18">Founders</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.nat_history.2.6"></a> and dedicated it to sharing
<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus’s</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.nat_history.2.8"></a> glory with the world.  To that end,
they established a means of constructing <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.41">Thresholds</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.nat_history.2.10"></a>—magical gates used to travel to and from
<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.nat_history.2.12"></a>.  Immigrants to the new nation were
slow to come at first, but they did arrive.  And as they arrived, they started
successful new lives in the bountiful valley.  Word spread, and the population
of <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.nat_history.2.14"></a> grew exponentially as people from
all over the continent came to investigate this new wonder and found their
expectations exceeded.  It was not long before the fledgling nation became the
hub of luxury, trade, and travel that it is today.</p></section><section id="player-guide.govt" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>The Government of Seorsus</h3></header><p>Outwardly, the government of <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.2.2"></a> is
composed of three parts: a Senate, an Emperor and <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.12">District Representatives</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.2.4"></a>.
Every four years, citizens elect <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.12">District Representatives</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.2.6"></a> to speak for their regions'
interests in government affairs. While they lack individual power, as a
collective the <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.12">District Representatives</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.2.8"></a> possess great strength, and most take immense
pride in their role. They elect the Emperor from their ranks and may even vote
to forcibly remove Senators from office for life. Consequently, even the most
powerful officials respect <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.12">District Representatives</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.2.10"></a> as the voice of the people.</p><p>The current Emperor, <span class="personname">Marshall Blackwood</span>, was elected five years ago. Thus far,
his term has been mostly uneventful. <span class="personname">Emperor Blackwood</span> has not
needed to wield his power to veto any major proposals, resolve clutch ties in
the Senate, or directly command the <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.30">National Police Force</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.3.4"></a>. Popular opinion is
that he will choose to hold a twenty year term like most of his predecessors,
though no law requires him to do so.</p><p>While the Emperor and <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.12">District Representatives</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.4.2"></a> are elected officials, each of the
nation’s eminent temples are granted a number of Senate seats corresponding to
their influence. Senators, once inaugurated, occupy their positions for life,
unless deposed by the <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.12">District Representatives</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.4.4"></a>. Because Senators wield mighty power
such as ratification of laws and calling for immediate re-election of the
Emperor, the temples deliberate carefully when selecting leaders to become
Senators. As a result, most Senators are level-headed and keenly aware that they
must walk the line between the interests of their temples, the people, and the
nation at large.</p><div class="sidebar"><header class="sidebar-titlepage"><h4>Who’s in the Senate?</h4></header><div class="sidebar-content"><p>A temple receives a number of Senate positions corresponding with its influence
in the nation, be it influence through size of congregation, wealth, or other
means. Currently, the temple of Abadar is allocated eight senate seats. Shelyn
holds three, and Sarenrae and Cayden Cailean each hold two. Pharasma, Iomedae,
and Erastil are all represented, but each holds only one seat.</p></div></div><p>In practice, of course, the government is much more than just the sum of its
leadership.  Of the various government agencies and divisions, the largest and
most publicly visible are the <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.30">National Police Force</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.6.2"></a>, the
<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.9">Department of Customs and Immigration</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.6.4"></a>, and the <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.34">Public Works Agency</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.6.6"></a>.  The
<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.30">National Police Force</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.6.8"></a> is charged with maintaining peace and safety throughout
the nation, and is the closest thing <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.6.10"></a> has to a
military force. The current head of police, <span class="personname">Nigel Croft</span>, continues
to uphold the organization’s excellent reputation.  Although he may claim that
they are chronicly understaffed and underfunded, <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.6.13"></a> is
an incredibly safe country.  The <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.9">Department of Customs and Immigration</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.6.15"></a> levying taxes on
exported goods, and also control and maintain the <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.41">magical gates</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.6.17"></a> that lead to <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.6.19"></a>. The <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.34">Public Works Agency</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.govt.6.21"></a>
builds and maintains infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and waterways. It
also settles disputes over public lands, most frequently regarding the ancient
relics scattered about the country.</p></section><section id="_religion_in_seorsus" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>Religion in Seorsus</h3></header><p>Although the nation is not aligned with any one deity,
<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus’s</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_religion_in_seorsus.2.2"></a> roots in the
<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.18">Founders</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_religion_in_seorsus.2.4"></a>' <a href="#player-guide.nat_history">religious crusade</a> are
still apparent to this day. The nation’s temples play a huge role in the
citizens' day-to-day lives. The temples act most directly by guiding the course
of the nation through the <a href="#player-guide.govt">Senators</a>, but also on a local
scale and in unseen ways as their values and agendas bleed into the surrounding
culture.</p><p>The temple of Abadar has maintained major power in the nation, and from the
gilded halls of <a href="#player-guide.abadar_temple">The First Capitol</a> in
<a href="#player-guide.law_city">Regunt</a> it oversees much of the nation’s financial
and legal well-being.  Shelyn and Cayden Cailean both have large followings in
<a href="#player-guide.arts_city">Oblectant</a>. Their temples,
<a href="#player-guide.shelyn_temple">Couatl’s Voice</a> and <a href="#player-guide.cc_temple">The Best Vault</a>, draw tourists and
worshippers from far and wide with the promise of first rate entertainment and
culture.</p><div class="sidebar"><header class="sidebar-titlepage"><h4>Mystery of the Shrines</h4></header><div class="sidebar-content"><p>Scattered around the landscape of <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_religion_in_seorsus.4.2.2"></a> are mysterious
shrines. The shrines wield various potent magics, from healing, to increased
strength and speed, to the ability to breath underwater for a time. Although the
purpose and origin of these shrines is contested fact, access to them is highly
valued, and many groups vie for stewardship of these relics.</p></div></div><p>Iomedae’s temple is the <a href="#player-guide.police_hq">Praesidium</a> in
<a href="#player-guide.law_city">Regunt</a>, and much of the <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.30">National Police Force</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_religion_in_seorsus.5.4"></a> are
devotees. Sarenrae, Pharasma, and Erastil enjoy large popular support from all
around the nation for their public services and good works, but they do not
maintain large shrines or temples in any one location.  Many other faiths have
worshippers in <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_religion_in_seorsus.5.6"></a>, and although they do not hold
prominent political power, Desna, Gozreh, Calistria, and Irori all have
noteworthy followings around the country. Meanwhile, abroad, the
<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.18">Founders</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_religion_in_seorsus.5.8"></a> work tirelessly to spread the gospel of
civilization’s crowning achievements, and in their triumph bring ever new and
excited souls to join as citizens.</p></section><section id="player-guide.central_cities" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>The Central Cities</h3></header><p>The Central Cities are the largest urban centers in <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="player-guide.central_cities.2.2"></a>.
They represent the peak of culture and progress in the nation, and each of them
has developed their own unique customs and specialties over time.</p><div class="sidebar"><header class="sidebar-titlepage"><h4>Common Government Resources</h4></header><div class="sidebar-content"><p>You can expect most government agencies that deal with infrastructure will have

leadership settle in <a href="#player-guide.law_city">Regunt</a> and take a post in a
guild or legal office. Dwarves in the legal realm tend to put their strong

barbarians trace their origins elsewhere in <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.31">Norolba</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_barbarians.2.4"></a>. In

traditionalism and battlelust, many <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.21">Hariq</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_barbarians.3.8"></a> are pragmatists
and some fund their tribe’s goals by working as mercenaries. Others may be

<a href="#player-guide.amphitheater">Dragon’s Teeth</a> amphitheater, the passions of
<a href="#player-guide.arts_city">Oblectant’s</a> citizens know no limits. This intensity has even

die so long as there is music in <a href="#player-guide.arts_city">Oblectant</a>.</p><p>Even outside of <a href="#player-guide.arts_city">Oblectant</a>, a performer has many
opportunities to excel. Politicians, storeowners, and merchant guilds are all
keenly aware of the impact a charismatic face can have, and many seek the
services of skilled spokesmen. Travelers, far from their homes, find comfort in
local song and art even in a land so distant. And a rural life may become grim

<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.6">Bestial Tribes</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_druids.2.8"></a>. Once in the country, druids tend to pursue their
own goals as wanderers, members of a grove, or even as members of larger
organizations for—or perhaps against—the government.</p><p>Groves are groups of druids that typially gather together at sites of particular
spiritual significance. There, they tend to flora and fauna of the area and
ensure that the site is preserved against any who would do it harm. The
<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.40">Three Bridge Falls Druids</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_druids.3.2"></a> are especially well known to locals and tourists for
their protection of the <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.39">Three Bridge Falls</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_druids.3.4"></a> area, and are perhaps more famous
than the druids would like.</p><p>Druids that are members of larger organizations tend to work with a temple or
the government. There they perform local functions such as ensuring that harbors
and rivers are maintained, and giving advance warning for weather. They may also
perform environmental advisories and studies for government projects. Not all
organizations are so friendly towards the smooth operation of local and national
government, however. One particularly infamous group, known as the
<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.4">Balancers</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_druids.4.2"></a>, are publicly a pro-nature lobbying group and they

they employ a wide range of skilled combat researchers and engineers to develop
new tactics and equipment. Fighters looking to earn more than the govnerment is
willing to pay might prefer to take on the role of bodyguard or strongman for a
wealthy noble or shop owner. Others still may prefer to take a riskier path and
bring their feats to the stage as combat performers —masquerading their
deadly arts as performance pieces or sport in the <a href="#player-guide.stadium">Lavender Fields</a> of

those who can provide guidance through unknown perils. Explorers and hunters ply
the forests and mountains for quarry of bear, wolves, mountain lions, or perhaps
an Aurumvorax caught feasting on a surface ore vein. The brave or foolhardy

<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.36">Seorsus</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_sorcerers.2.2"></a>, and a sorcerer’s ability to instanly access the full
wealth of her magical strengths is an invaluable tool for responding to sudden
windfalls. In the bustling <a href="#player-guide.central_cities">Central Cities</a>,
sorcerers are valued as enchanters in crafting workshops, but they are
especially valued in <a href="#player-guide.arts_city">Oblectant</a>. There, the

<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.24">Light the Sky! Fireworks and other Visual Effects!</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_sorcerers.2.6"></a> has specialized in this field, and keeps a sizable
retinue of magical adepts on retainer for hire by performers in need.</p><p>A sorcerer’s natural force of personality also benefits those who choose to
employ their powers to further some goal beyond wealth and entertainment. Many
sorcerers of celestial and infernal bloodlines take leadership positions in
local government and mercantile operations, where they excel in bringing allies
and adversaries under their sway. Others still choose to unleash the full extent
of their potential as members of the <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.30">National Police Force</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_sorcerers.3.2"></a>.</p></section><section id="_wizards" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Wizards</h4></header><p>The vast libraries and combined cultural knowledge of the

transit using the country’s <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.41">magical gates</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_wizards.2.7"></a>. This approval
process also involves the charging of keys for the gates and their tranmission

<em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.9">Department of Customs and Immigration</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_wizards.2.9"></a> funds research grants for these wizards and also
provides shelter and workspaces.</p><p>Craftsman also value skilled wizards, and many vie to employ the best in their

the end results of the creative process. <em class="glossterm"><a href="#glossary.5">Berthold’s Magic Supply</a></em><a class="indexterm" name="_wizards.3.2"></a> is a

motivations, or personality. They help you provide a few quick blurbs about
aspects of your character and reward you with mechanical benefits for defining
these concepts. Traits also serve to help other players and the GM understand
how all the characters might integrate as a party.</p><p>You may choose two character traits at the start of the scenario. You may not
choose the same trait twice. Combat, Equipment, Faith, Magic, Race, Regional,
Religion, and Social traits are not listed in this guide and should be taken
from other material if you wish to use them. This guide defines only Campaign
traits.</p><p>In addition to your character traits, your party should also work together to
establish preexisting connections between each character and at least one other
party member. Try to spread out these connections as much as possible between
the members of the group. This will give the group cohesion and reason for
sticking together rather than working alone. Remember, you can always ask your
GM for assistance with establishing traits and bonds between characters.</p><section id="_campaign_traits" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h4>Campaign Traits</h4></header><p>Campaign traits are character traits that are guaranteed to be integrated with
some part of the scenario’s storyline. They provide you with a surefire way to
tie your character into the story and seed your thoughts with ideas for
character motivation and history. To accomplish this, they are much more
prescriptive than other types of traits. You do not have to choose a campaign
trait as one of your two character traits, but if you don’t you should discuss
your character with your GM so that she can plan out how to involve your
character with the story.</p><p>It bears repeating that no matter what traits you choose, you should always
strive to establish a pre-existing connection with at least one other character
in the party before play begins. Campaign traits are a fast and effective way to
do this, but are not the only way.</p><section id="_attacked_by_gnolls" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h5>Attacked by Gnolls</h5></header><p>You were attacked by a band of gnolls recently in your life, and now you harbor

though you were not killed—due to either resourcefulness or blind
luck—many of your friends and loved ones were. Or perhaps your caravan was
attacked on the road and you lost your belongings or close companions to the
gnollish bandits. Whatever the situation, you’ve had something dear stripped
from you, and your dreams are haunted by cackles and barks in the night. You’ve
sworn to yourself that no gnoll will escape from you alive from this day on, and
you’ve taken to studying them with malicious fervor.</p><p>You may choose one of the following trait bonuses:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li><p>You receive a +2 trait bonus to Perception checks made to keep watch.</p></li><li><p>Add Abyssal (cannot speak) and Gnollish to your list of languages.</p></li></ul></div></section><section id="_shadows_of_the_past" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h5>Shadows of the Past</h5></header><p>Someone, or multiple people, dear to you have been forcibly taken away before

patronizing your business. The damage dealt to your image was so severe that you

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p><section id="_preamble" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h2>Preamble</h2></header><p>The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.</p><p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program—​to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.</p><p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p><p>Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.</p><p>A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.</p><p>The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.</p><p>An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.</p><p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</p></section><section id="_terms_and_conditions" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2></header><section id="_0_definitions" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>0. Definitions.</h3></header><p>"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.</p><p>"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.</p><p>"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.</p><p>To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.</p><p>A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.</p><p>To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p><p>To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p><p>An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p></section><section id="_1_source_code" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>1. Source Code.</h3></header><p>The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.</p><p>A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.</p><p>The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p><p>The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.</p><p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</p><p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.</p></section><section id="_2_basic_permissions" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>2. Basic Permissions.</h3></header><p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p><p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p><p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.</p></section><section id="_3_protecting_users_legal_rights_from_anti_circumvention_law" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h3></header><p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.</p><p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.</p></section><section id="_4_conveying_verbatim_copies" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h3></header><p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p><p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p></section><section id="_5_conveying_modified_source_versions" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h3></header><p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;"><li><p>The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
it, and giving a relevant date.</p></li><li><p>The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.
This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
"keep intact all notices".</p></li><li><p>You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</p></li><li><p>If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
work need not make them do so.</p></li></ol></div><p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.</p></section><section id="_6_conveying_non_source_forms" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h3></header><p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;"><li><p>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
customarily used for software interchange.</p></li><li><p>Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</p></li><li><p>Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
with subsection 6b.</p></li><li><p>Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</p></li><li><p>Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
charge under subsection 6d.</p></li></ol></div><p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.</p><p>A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.</p><p>"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</p><p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).</p><p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.</p><p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.</p></section><section id="_7_additional_terms" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>7. Additional Terms.</h3></header><p>"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p><p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p><p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;"><li><p>Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</p></li><li><p>Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
Notices displayed by works containing it; or</p></li><li><p>Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</p></li><li><p>Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or</p></li><li><p>Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</p></li><li><p>Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
those licensors and authors.</p></li></ol></div><p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p><p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.</p><p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.</p></section><section id="_8_termination" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>8. Termination.</h3></header><p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).</p><p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p><p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.</p><p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.</p></section><section id="_9_acceptance_not_required_for_having_copies" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h3></header><p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p></section><section id="_10_automatic_licensing_of_downstream_recipients" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h3></header><p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p><p>An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p><p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p></section><section id="_11_patents" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>11. Patents.</h3></header><p>A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor’s "contributor version".</p><p>A contributor’s "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.</p><p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p><p>In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.</p><p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p><p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.</p><p>A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p><p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p></section><section id="_12_no_surrender_of_others_freedom" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h3></header><p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p></section><section id="_13_remote_network_interaction_use_with_the_gnu_general_public_license" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.</h3></header><p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.</p><p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.</p></section><section id="_14_revised_versions_of_this_license" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h3></header><p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.</p><p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.</p><p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy’s
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.</p><p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.</p></section><section id="_15_disclaimer_of_warranty" class="section"><header class="section-titlepage"><h3>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h3></header><p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY

possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p><p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least

network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.</p><p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.

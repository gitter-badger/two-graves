# How to contribute

## First Steps

* Make sure you have a [Bitbucket account](https://bitbucket.org)

## Making Changes

* Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch. Create a topic 
branch for your work.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master: `git checkout -b
BRANCHNAME master`. For example, `git checkout -b issue130 master` 
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository. See [this documentation] for
instructions.
